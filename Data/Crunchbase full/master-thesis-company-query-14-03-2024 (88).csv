When it comes to laundromats, it takes a large space and a large capital investment to open dozens of facilities in every city.

We blend state of the art CRM software, the best talent in Tennessee, and proven communication strategies aimed at acquiring retail-based consumers. In short, we’ve created a business model based on serving others, whether that be our clients, their customers, or our team…and we do it with pride.    We haven’t revolutionized the way corporations attract new customers — we just do it in a more efficient, cost-effective, timely manner. The executive team at Teal Marketing Inc has created a niche in 4 areas: Sales Consulting, Direct Marketing, Customer Acquisition, and Management Training. Though they may each sound different, the concepts are all intertwined and feed into one another. Marketing a product face to face generates a sale. Sales acquire new customers, and systematic training processes generate the expertise our client wants managing new office locations. All of Teal Marketing Inc's services are managed personally and locally, rather than through mass marketing efforts. We come into each customer interaction well-educated and with a solution in mind, taking the time to understand the unique needs of each individual customer. Our interactions, in a retail-based setting, ensure our clients receive the visibility they seek and the amount of market growth they desire.
