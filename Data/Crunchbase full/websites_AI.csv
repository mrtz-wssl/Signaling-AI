For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020.  PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains.  -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball.""  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value.  -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our ""credit score for transparency."" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore.  ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development.  -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.    BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system, all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh, safe products at full margin.  CUSTOMER PROFILE Transparent Path technologies support food, pharmaceuticals, blood/plasma, transplant organs, and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods.  PARTNERSHIPS Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Duke University, and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market, and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore.  ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORS Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT.  FUNDRAISING To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, three grants, and four angel investors. In April 2023, the company was awarded grants totaling $440,000 from the National Science Foundation, ReFED, and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.   FOR MORE INFORMATION Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business. His executive team includes senior leaders from Amazon, General Mills, Microsoft, Target, KraftHeinz, Xerox PARC, and the University of California at Berkeley.

The first is KwikSign - a digital signature app, which doesn't sound particularly innovative but we've approached the problem from a different angle. Our vision of the future is that people won't want to just sign contracts. There are new problems to be solved. They will need to sign any asset to either prove that they own it, approve it, agree with it, or want to protect it. This could be any asset type - contracts, video, audio, designs, drawings, deeds, code and more. In an age of artificial intelligence and fake information it's more important than ever to validate the authenticity of any asset. We achieve this by enabling any file type to be checked, validated, signed and recorded on a blockchain thereby creating a tamperproof record. Everything that is created can be linked to the validated identity of the validators to prove it is true and original. What are the use cases for this? There are many - creating deeds of ownership, issuing stock or share certificates, carrying out due diligence, recording intellectual property, confirming that a video, photo or audio file is the true and original version, in fact creating a tamperproof record of any event or asset. Our second product, launching next month, takes this one step further. Once an asset is created it needs to be transferable, tradable and traceable. To solve this problem we have built a SuperNFT which is an asset linked to the validated identities of the creators or legal owners. Because the SuperNFT 'knows' who its owners are it is also a mechanism for collecting and disbursing monies to the rightful beneficiaries, and it does this Super-quickly. Our first foray is in the world of music to enable artists to create new experiences for their audiences and to enable artists to be paid more quickly and more accurately.",11-50,1.0,IPO,2021-08-02,1800000.0,Seed,1800000.0,7.0,11-50,Public,2022-03-14,,,,,0,2,2021,7653,False,False

Companies could use it to plan their corporate strategy via their current Enterprise Resource Planning tools by interfacing them to our AGI and having it watch and learn their company’s internal operations, gather data about their whole ecosystem of customers, suppliers, partners, competitors, and the other market factors, then forecast different timelines and how they evolve into the future differently according to their decisions, allowing you to optimize their corporate decision-making and plan effective prescient timelines for product development, marketing/PR, sales, finance, legal,… into the future. Ordinary people can use it to plan their lives, evaluating different decisions they could make, from career, to marriage, to finances, and to see the trajectory of events that would result, and the probable outcomes. They can access AGI professional services like Finance, Legal, Medical, Counselor, Fitness Advisor, and hundreds of others, and these services would be available globally, rivaling the best such services by humans. An Artificial General Intelligence will quickly become the most powerful tool that humanity has ever had, making the revolutions spawned by electricity, computers, and the internet pale by comparison.

Does this conversation sound familiar? I have this problem at ZIP code 39531. Can you fix it, when can you fix it and how much will it cost? Our A.I replies to that request with answers to each part. Example service request: “39531 toilet won’t flush” Example A.I assistant reply: Service Name: Toilet Repair (Won't Flush, Running, Clog) Estimated Price: $85 Soonest Arrival Window: 10/18 Thur, 9:00am-10:00am Click here to order this service Or find similar services here  Hometown Workforce is like DoorDash for services with an A.I assistant that helps consumers hire service providers. These people create a series of service listings on our marketplace. Consumers then pick the service they need, choose an available start time, and deposit 1% of the estimated total down. This 1% contractually obligates the person to show up on time and complete the work for the price estimated. If they don't they risk losing access to the platform.  This order process also runs the person's entire business. It manages payments, provides jobs, and schedules those jobs. All the person has to do is show up on time and do a good job. In exchange for this commitment to being honest and reliable, our tech can turn the skills of virtually anyone regardless of race, gender, background, or circumstances into a successful business. Angie's List and all the other lead gen sites do one thing. They connect consumers with contractors. They can't schedule the job. They can't verify the quality of work and they can't verify the price is fair. Without all 4 you can't effectively help consumers complete jobs. We take care of all 4 and more! MISSION STATEMENT: Our mission is to help eliminate poverty by turning people's skills into successful businesses. This is the first true solution to poverty I'm aware of. It's also perhaps the most powerful tool ever conceived for incentivizing people to be honest and reliable.  HOW OUR TECHNOLOGY WORKS: What makes this platform truly revolutionary is the series of listings people create on our marketplace. These listings pre-price and pre-timed their individual services.  Since each service is pre-priced we can standardize prices which eliminates price gouging, it also ensures the person gets paid.  Since each service is pre-timed the consumer can look at the person's work calendar and see all the available openings with enough hours to accommodate the specific job. Then they pick one which ensures the person shows up on time. It also provides them with jobs and manages every hour of every day. It tells the person where to go, what to do, and when to be there. There are billions of ordinary people who have skills people will pay for. They just have no idea how to turn those skills into a successful business. That’s exactly what Hometown Workforce does! We also have a training division that can provide people with skills. You choose a trade, we partner you with an instructor who will create listings specific to your career path. Consumers order those services and after you learn to do the work on the job. All the listings are turned over to you and instantly you have a successful business.

Critical decisions cannot wait for manual analysis to create contextual meaning from insights, they need to be automated to deliver decision guidance and Augmented Outcomes for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. Decision Point AI™ is the company that has an Augmented Intelligence Platform that facilitates Decisive Impact for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. It utilises Decision Science instead of Data Science to focus corporate efforts on critical and Augmented Outcomes to deliver Decisive Impact to its clients. Decision Point AI™ is vertical and horizontal Market agnostic and is focused on technology and consultancy services for any industry or organisation. Our Augmented Intelligence Platform is already in use in Government decision making and Decision Point is currently engaging with a number of commercial clients on their specific business cases. Decision Science Data driven decision making augmented intelligence #dddm_ai ""Decision Point AI™ augmented intelligence supports decision making when there is a lack of data to otherwise make decisions"" While the standard pathway for Decision Science is to focus on data as a tool to make decisions and solve business problems. Decision Point has further augmented the current thinking by adding collated data through an augmented intelligence platform and applying human interpretive algorithms that enable expert context to establish both true meaning and trajectory in a real time manner. Real time DDDM through Decision Point AI™ dddm_ai establishes a clear competitive advantage in a world where enterprises are told competitive advantage no longer exists DDDM_AI is fundamentally different from the slower data science route which is involved in finding insights by analysis and modelling from data, after this data has been collected, processed and structured by data engineer. While business who are ""driven most by data-based decision making had 4% higher productivity rates and 5-6% higher profits, a study of 179 large publicly traded firms"" by Brynjolfsson, Hitt and Kim of MIT Center for Digital Business found in 2011 based on Data Science. No impact analysis currently exist for the evolutionary real time DDDM_AI that utilises augmented intelligence but by extrapolation the expectation is for higher productivity, utilisation and profits for client companies. Subjective Logic Augmented Intelligence A fundamental aspect of the human condition is that nobody can ever determine with absolute certainty whether a proposition about the world is true or false. The human capacity to create theories or hunches can have profound impact on the direction and effectiveness of organisations, enterprise and countries. Decision Point utilises an Augmented Intelligence Platform built on subjective logic to refine and explicitly emphasise the factors and certainties that underwrite decision options. Additionally the Decision Point Augmented Intelligence Platform utilises human insights as part of its data queries to augment the processing power of the AI with context and meaning of that data through human knowledge and expertise. Subjective logic is a type of probabilistic logic that combines the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Subjective logic explicitly takes uncertainty and source data trust into account. Subjective logic is suitable for modelling and analysing situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources. Subjective logic can be used for modelling and analysing trust networks where a measurement of the degree to which one social actor (an individual or a group) trusts another social actor and Bayesian networks that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,4,2019,41240,False,False

We use AI to enhance fitness instructors, not to replace them, because we believe it's time to put community back into community-based fitness. With 9 out of 10 Americans planning to continue to work-out from home traditional fitness is getting left behind with pen & pencil or low-tech band-aids while AI fitness is removing the human element altogether.

With our unique approach of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks, KAPUA's customers enjoy MAPEs (mean absolute percentage error) and WMAPEs (weighted mean absolute percentage error) in the lower single digits. This increased accuracy allows organizations to lower working capital while improving fulfillment levels.   Related research in this field suggests a 3M profit increase on a 100M business driven by a 10-20% improvement of forecasting accuracy, and KAPUA set out to take this even further. In multiple cases, we're able to reduce a company's forecasting error to a 10th of what it was before. As AI is taking over a lot of the manual work, planners can now focus on developing new strategies to maximize revenue and minimize working capital.
