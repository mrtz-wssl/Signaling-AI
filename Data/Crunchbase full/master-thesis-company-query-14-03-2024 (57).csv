Users complete a psychometric/habit/demographic questionnaire using a novel ""slider"" (patent pending), then the app reorders staff- and user-generated plans into what is most likely to work for the user, based on ratings by similar users. These plans increasingly start with short-form videos as those are getting the best engagement.  Initial trials of the app were for university students and oriented towards providing plans to indigenous students, youth with disabilities entering the workforce, and people afflicted by mental health issues. Now, eight new universities are set to come on board to provide our service to foster youth in the United States, Canada, and South Africa.  Universities and colleges have been a great starting place. We are focused on growing in that market and refining our product. In the long run, however, the function of the app opens the possibility for questions and plans to be catered to just about any audience while using the same technology, allowing us to potentially help countless other groups. All it takes is questions and plans (which the AI helps improve over time) and a user base (at least 1,000 users) who want to achieve something.

Our expertise is specifically in managing projects for CAD, RMS, JMS, and Mobile solutions.   As NPSG only consults for public safety software, we put a tremendous amount of effort into the research of the providers, how to best procure, and how to best implement these technologies. Our services are very different than what standard public safety consultants offer, as they also offer many other services. They offer a broad range of services, each taking a tremendous amount of knowledge to be great at, such as Land Mobile Radio, Call Premise Equipment, cybersecurity, staffing analyses, consolidation studies, hazardous mitigations studies, building construction, smart cities, on body and in car video, and much more. We solely put all of our focus on public safety software. NPSG also hires team members who have extensive experience in public safety software projects. Most of our team members worked in public safety, and most of our team members worked at a Tier 1 public safety software company, understanding the details of how companies sell, implement, upgrade, and support their solutions. This gives us great insight when working on your project. As a concierge service, we also assign a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for each part of your project. Each project has a product SME for each product (CAD, RMS, JMS, MDS), but you also get a Needs Assessment expert, a Selection expert, a Procurement expert for contract negotiation, as well as a Project Manager, so each part of your project has an expert guiding you through the process. This concierge service takes a large burden off our customers as they work to implement these large complex solutions. We take the burden off agencies directly relating to workload, as we take a lot of work off our agencies during these projects. But we also take the mental burden off of our agencies by thoroughly educating them each step of the way. Our customers know they are making educated choices, not best guess estimates, during these complex projects. When we say that excellent customer service is important to us, we ensure that we are held to that standard. We do that in two ways. One, we offer a cancel anytime clause in our agreement, so if at any time an agency is not happy with our services, they can cancel their agreement with us. Secondly, our reference list is our customer list. Every agency we work with is listed as a reference regardless of what they might say. We do this confidently, knowing that we have provided excellent customer service to them.

Every player can find a relevant opponent due to global ranking built into the app, a coach that fits all the criteria, a court nearby that he can also pay for immediately, a tennis club with possible registration for ongoing tournaments. The application prototype is now ready and in early January we will launch the first beta version for testing both iOS and Android platforms. Our target markets are Australia, USA, Canada and EU. The launch in the US will take place in September-October 2022. Before that, the app will be tested and will acquire its first users in Russia. There is a big problem in the tennis world right now - we see lots of unqualified coaches who are picking up their racquets and as a result are not teaching their students correctly. We are solving this problem by verifying coaches through KYC. We provide verified coaches with a blue check mark. Coaches themselves will be able to create and fill out their own schedule. After each practice session the client will be able to leave a rating and feedback for the coach. For the integrated tennis courts (initially there will be 55 in partnership with findsport.ru) we are bringing in new clients and facilitating schedule bookings.  For the tennis clubs we are providing an opportunity to sign up new members. Monetization: there is a paid subscription for players since the basic version is free. As for tennis courts and coaches we offer a boost that will place them at the top of the search list. There are also advertising spots within the app. From January 1, 2023 the app will have its own tennis e-commerce platform and branded merchandise.

AWP Wood Products,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/awp-wood-products,2022-09-02,day,,"Little Rock, Arkansas, United States",AWP Wood Products is a hardwood plywood and lumber distributor and a manufacturer of high-quality millwork and molding.,"776,511",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://www.awpwoodproducts.com/,https://twitter.com/VictorBarringer,,"AWP Wood Products is a distributor of hardwood plywood and lumber as well as a manufacturer of high-quality millwork and molding. In addition to its physical location in Little Rock, AR, the company also offers Build-proud.com, an online catalog that services those in the custom cabinet industry. This platform gives our customers “ a one-stop shopping “  for all of our customers. AWP's distribution areas cover several states, including Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama, and Texas. Because of the desire to provide the best in the industry to customers, AWP works with industry-leading providers of lumber and plywood and buys an annual volume of Hardwood lumber board footage of around 9 million board feet. Regular purchases include hard and soft maple, poplar, FAS red oak, and 4/4 Northern and Appalachian KD material. On average, the company also purchases annually around 50 containers of exotic lumber, between 50 to 75 truckloads of MDF, and nearly 500 truckloads of hardwood plywood. It is also common for AWP to secure nearly 45 truckloads of Poplar and Red Oak gang ripped blanks each year. In 2014, Victor Barringer purchased and rebranded the company that is now doing business as AWP. The letters stand for Acadian Wood Products. Build- Proud.com, a sister company, and supplier of all things related to custom cabinetry, was launched in 2019 and also has its home office in the Little Rock area. The Build-Proud.com goal is straightforward: exactly what you need, at a price you can afford, in our direct markets and nationwide. The commitment to quality is found in the mission state of AWP. The goal is to work with both vendors and consumers to deliver unparalleled service, products, and solutions within the specialty hardwoods market. Given the wide range of woods offered, AWP fuels the construction of flooring, furniture, cabinetry, and more across the nation. Through BuildProud, buyers can expect top-quality merchandise and old-school services as the team sources the products requested at the best prices. This promise of quality and service equates to both considerable savings and hassle-free transactions, and customer reviews indicate a positive working relationship exists with each account. Says Victor Barring, “ I am the Chief Quality Control Officer, relationships mean something to AWP, our top accounts have my direct line and can call me anytime its if not right. “  With the need to successfully interact within a global economy and to support sustainable and ethical business practices, it is important to join a professional organization where peers and industry experts become valuable resources and contacts. For AWP, there are four well-recognized associations where the company maintains active memberships. These are: Indiana Hardwood Lumbermen’s Association National Hardwood Lumber Association Hardwood Distributors Association Cabinet Makers Association. Between the product offerings of BuildProud and the AWP operations, consumers find more options with hardwood and specialty woodworking. The diverse inventory accommodates needs for both standard and rare items, but the in-house millwright and molding program allows skilled craftsmen to have more control over the products and customizations requested. This is a significant advantage over the competition in the industry, as the work does not get outsourced to a third party and results in cost savings passed along to the consumer. It’s a big reason that over the last two years, sales were up 62%, and the company added more than 300 new accounts.",https://www.facebook.com/awpwoodproducts/,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,
