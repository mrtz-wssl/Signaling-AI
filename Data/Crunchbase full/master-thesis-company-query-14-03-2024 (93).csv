Humans and nature can and should exist in productive harmony, which is why businesses and people should do more than just make money and amass wealth:  they should act in ways that improve the world while making money.  20th Century capitalism operated under two flawed assumptions. First, Planet Earth has unlimited resources. Second, individuals can and should amass unlimited wealth for their own benefit.  As the world is awakening in the 21st Century, both of these assumptions are proving to be unsustainable. Finance is a key lever for change and can play a major role in shaping a more sustainable future.
