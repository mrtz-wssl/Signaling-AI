My camera was my brush, Syria is my canvas, and the revolution has become my art. When the Syrian revolution began over 10 years ago, I was one of hundreds of thousands of peaceful activists that took to the streets demanding that our government treat us with dignity and respect. My government responded with brute force to quell the peaceful protests. They used, and continue to use, every means at their disposal to destroy our minds, souls, and bodies. But, their brutality only gave us more reason to continue fighting. WHAT IS MY VISION? Syria must be free from dictatorship and all political detainees must be released.

The company was founded in 2018 by a team of analysts and investment professionals who had formerly worked as part of a development group in a San Francisco angel capital office.  Previously, the team had been tasked with building various in-house data solutions, including one to supply structured XBRL financials to subsidiary Revere Data (later acquired by FACTSET).  It was through this experience that the basis of SDS as a standalone provider was born.   The lightbulb moment for the team came when it moved beyond standard financials (Income Statement/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) and began mining esoteric tables buried in 10K/Qs, such as REIT FFO (Funds From Operations) for a hedge fund manager client.  Although outside of the ordinary workflow, SDS tools easily accomplished the task with a skeleton crew of staff and a microscopic budget (compared to incumbent data purveyors).  At that point, the decision was made to commercialize. Since 2018, SDS has been in stealth mode, quietly improving its semantic parsing engine and its user interface, while preparing for a public launch.  We intend to disrupt a well established and very static industry which currently relies mostly on manual processes to populate databases.  Through automation, our platform improves the efficiency of collecting, maintaining, and updating financial information by an order of magnitude.   SDS anticipates an initial release in Fall of 2020.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,13,,,,,,,

We intend to encourage the Americas Region talent (also the Region Emerging talent) to integrate into the financial sector, either as educated users who seek to improve their future projections or for all those who want a career change or better yet start a career in a highly demanding sector. Our intention is to pave the way for the integration of Latin American Regional Talent into newly emerging markets and established US Institutional Centers. We welcome those who seek an education necessary to elevate students into careers all across the financial spectrum. We are pioneers in providing an education for sustainability, cultivating financial talent for application in global leadership positions.Our team is acutely aware of the utmost importance of the Latin American region composed of over 20 countries and 625 million people. As the fastest growing minority within the United States, Latin America will surely play a distinct role in the history of the Western Hemisphere for the century to come. The region has historically benefited from global demand for its commodities, but lesser-known thriving domestic consumption and a growing manufacturing and technology sector is fueling unprecedented economic advancement. Once shunned by investors and businesses due to the “boom and bust” nature of many of the region’s local economies, stringent monetary policies have allowed many of these countries to develop well capitalized banking systems exhibiting healthy credit records. Regional wealth, entrepreneurship and direct investment activity have increased significantly in recent years. By 2017, foreign direct investments into Latin America and the Caribbean exceeded US$ 167 billion annually with a slim majority of inflows directed to medium-high and high-technology sectors.Brasil, México, Chile, Colombia and Peru have received the bulk of recent investments, but distressed nations such as Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba remain poised for monumental shifts. The Netherlands, U.S., and Spain have historically been the largest foreign investors in Latin America with China, Russia, Japan, UK, and other important economies playing a large role as well. Today the region is experiencing the positive impact of the talented forces managing LatAm Governments, Regulatory Agencies, Central Banks, Public and Corporate Pension Funds, Foundations, Endowments, Banks, Family Offices, Fund of Funds, Listed and Private Corporations, Insurance Companies, Private Banking Divisions, Asset Managers, Financial Boutiques, Investment Advisors and High-Net-Worth Individuals. In the United States, the growing Hispanic community is creating incredible opportunities for cross marketing and distribution. This progress is sustaining a developing Latin American middle class all across the globe. There still remains an extent of work to be done to help the region achieve its full potential, and Ilafin in partnership with WallStreetSur is delighted to be at the forefront of this region’s consolidation process by helping market participants and other stakeholders benefit from the upcoming period of unparalleled growth and opportunity in the global and local capital markets. Our intention consists in closing the educational gap and bringing talented people into the fascinating Asset Management Community. It is our hope that investors, overall market participants, students, and simple individuals may all play a role in the never-ending goal of building a better society.",https://www.facebook.com/ILAfinAmericas-178205789705115/,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Education, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",1,Victor Hugo Rodriguez,11-50,1,Seed,2019-07-05,,,,Pre-Seed,,,,Pre-Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,

The ‘freemium’ business model taps into the billions (such as CA’s Prop 63’s annual $2Bill for child mental health & $4.4Bill youth behavior health initiative 2021) spent on teenage mental health by parents, schools, state and federal agencies. Our initial pilot showed reduction in depression, initiated behavior change, goal setting & empowerment within 3 weeks of engagement. As well as High levels of engagement, clicks & positive feedback: “I started U4U because I was feeling insecure & thought U4U could help, I was so right…im loving it.” 15yr NC; “I’m so grateful for this community.”16 yr old TX. We are looking to raise $500K in a pre-seed round to build out the product MVP and broaden the pilot. Initial conversations with schools, adolescent therapists & adolescent dietitians have uncovered strong interest & eagerness to partner in distributing. U4U Teen is on a mission to utilize leading tech solutions to build out its community & an app to support teen girls across the US and globe through mental health challenges & teen life changes so that they can be successful in reaching their fullest potential.  The Surgeon General has listed teen mental health at a 'crisis' level. Studies of teen girls show that 1 in 5 suffer from depression, +25% have tried self-harm, +10% have eating disorders & +35% have body image issues, so it's no wonder that the New York Times (https://nyti.ms/38eMjKq) and many others are pointing out that teen girls need help. Yet, parents are busy, schools are full & girls are turning to social media to cope which is amplifying the negative statistics.  Digital health was one of the top VC investment segment in 2021 attracting $57B of funding globally. Digital behavioral/mental and wellness health was the largest and fastest growing segment with 139% YoY growth topping $5.5B funding (source: CB Insights). The mental health apps market is expected to grow to $17.5B by 2030 (source: Grand View Research Inc.). While teens represent $142 bill in direct spend (Forbes).
