I wanted to create a company that could provide the kind of gear that I knew military personnel and outdoor enthusiasts alike would be able to depend on. From the start, our goal has been to design and manufacture products that are not only practical and functional but also built to last. We started out small, working out of a garage with just a handful of employees. But our commitment to quality quickly gained us a reputation within the industry, and demand for our products grew. Before we knew it, we had outgrown our garage and had to move into a larger facility. Today, Anvil Tactical is a leading provider of tactical gear, survival gear, and camping gear. We have a team of experienced designers and engineers who work tirelessly to ensure that every product we produce meets our high standards. From backpacks to flashlights, we’re proud to offer a wide range of products that are designed to help our customers tackle any challenge they may face in the field. But our commitment to our customers doesn’t end with the products we make. We also believe in providing exceptional customer service and support. We know that our customers depend on our gear to keep them safe and secure, and we take that responsibility seriously. That’s why we offer a satisfaction guarantee on all of our products and why we’re always happy to answer any questions our customers may have. At Anvil Tactical, we’re more than just a company that sells gear. We’re a team of dedicated professionals who are passionate about helping our customers stay safe and prepared. Whether you’re a military veteran, an outdoor enthusiast, or just someone who wants the best gear for their next adventure, we’re here to help.",https://facebook.com/anviltactical,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,

Similar business methods are currently being tested by other providers; none have created a genuinely fraud-free environment for electronic transactions.  It does not matter if the sale is face to face, mail order, telephone order or E-commerce; our solution is fraud proof and eliminates the need for any PCI compliance.  It does not take the transactions out of scope for PCI compliance; it removes the need for PCI compliance. If cardholder information is neither captured by nor processed through the merchant, then there is no need for the merchant to comply with PCI compliance standards.  The cardholder will find no need to carry a credit/debit card with them, whether in the wallet, purse or mobile wallet.  By removing the need to transmit any card data in any form to or from the merchant, we have eliminated any need for PCI compliance. There is more!  With no cardholder data transmitted to the merchant, the consumer no longer needs to carry their credit/debit cards.  Now, except for the cardholder data that is stored at the acquirer and the issuing bank, there is nothing of value available for the hacker to steal.
