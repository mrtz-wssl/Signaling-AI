Also, NFTs make it possible for you to receive a percentage every time your work is sold or changes hands, so you are guaranteed a percentage of the profit if the work gains popularity and increases in price, not to mention, it’s just cool! NIFTY Souq is committed to ZERO minting costs for all artists launching NFTs on the platform, in addition to dedicated onboarding support to bring your NFT vision to life. With ZERO minting costs, artists can price their NFTs affordably, granting them access to more fans. Who we are At NIFTY Souq, we’re excited to be bringing a brand-new type of digital goods to the MENA region through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital files, which are provably scarce and useable across multiple applications. Like physical goods, you can do whatever you want with them! You can collect them, gift them, sell them, and even destroy them! They are digital files that are armed with all the programmable securities to allow them to become digital assets. A core part of our vision is to bring NFT and its technology to the MENA region to where users truly own this powerful brand of new digital items. Open, liquid marketplaces will help power these new economies and support artists to monetize through NFTs and digital assets. Therefore, we are working with a community of passionate users, developers, and creators to build the MENA’s first marketplace for NFTs.

The first is KwikSign - a digital signature app, which doesn't sound particularly innovative but we've approached the problem from a different angle. Our vision of the future is that people won't want to just sign contracts. There are new problems to be solved. They will need to sign any asset to either prove that they own it, approve it, agree with it, or want to protect it. This could be any asset type - contracts, video, audio, designs, drawings, deeds, code and more. In an age of artificial intelligence and fake information it's more important than ever to validate the authenticity of any asset. We achieve this by enabling any file type to be checked, validated, signed and recorded on a blockchain thereby creating a tamperproof record. Everything that is created can be linked to the validated identity of the validators to prove it is true and original. What are the use cases for this? There are many - creating deeds of ownership, issuing stock or share certificates, carrying out due diligence, recording intellectual property, confirming that a video, photo or audio file is the true and original version, in fact creating a tamperproof record of any event or asset. Our second product, launching next month, takes this one step further. Once an asset is created it needs to be transferable, tradable and traceable. To solve this problem we have built a SuperNFT which is an asset linked to the validated identities of the creators or legal owners. Because the SuperNFT 'knows' who its owners are it is also a mechanism for collecting and disbursing monies to the rightful beneficiaries, and it does this Super-quickly. Our first foray is in the world of music to enable artists to create new experiences for their audiences and to enable artists to be paid more quickly and more accurately.",https://www.facebook.com/KwikTrust/,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Privacy and Security, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",7,"Artur Pszczolkowski, Delia Sabau, Hassam Khawaja, Nick Spiller, Nick Spiller, Simon Read, Yasir Qayam",11-50,1,IPO,2021-08-02,1800000,USD,1800000,Seed,1800000,USD,1800000,Seed,1800000,USD,1800000,1800000,USD,1800000,,,,,,,,,,Public,2022-03-14,,,,,,,KTX,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/kwiktrust-ipo--459334c2,,,,,1.56%,2,,,,,,,,,,
