Our focus is on novel compounds that: 1) have platform capability where one molecule can treat multiple diseases with severe unmet clinical need, 2) will get preferred regulatory treatment due to the high unmet need and breakthrough potential, and 3) need relatively small clinical trials to achieve approval. Our 1st in class gene therapy (ET-101) has been engineered to overexpress Caveolin-1, which organizes & regulates synaptic receptors essential for neuromuscular signaling and function. It can treat a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases through precise, targeted overexpression of Caveolin-1 in neurons . We are also advancing a new generation of tissue factor (TF) therapies (ET-201) – therapeutics designed to target the cell surface receptor now known to be prevalent on solid tumor cells, tumor vasculature, and tumor stem cells, but absent on normal cells. By targeting these proteins which play a central role in the pathology of inflammation and angiogenesis, we can stop tumor growth, spread, and recurrence. Our first indications are neurodegenerative diseases and cancers with high unmet need and high mortality (e.g. ALS and triple negative breast cancer).

Powder Watts has de risked the technology and is in its second year of full commercial operations, with hundreds of locations and zero customer attrition. The TAM is 20M locations for Rooftop and another independent 18 to 20M locations for the upcoming Driveway and Walkway product. Total energy savings opportunity is greater than 140TWh each year for just the Rooftop product, representing greater than 70M tons of CO2 offset for rooftop and 200M combined. Uniquely, Powder Watts does all of this with close to zero carbon footprint from the manufacturing supply chain AND operations, coining the mark, Zero Carbon Energy. Powder Watts has secured their supply chain, perfected backend and app code, and is in the process of scaling to 100,000 plus locations. Utility companies large and small offer customer incentives of up to 70 percent to install the Powder Watts system, making ROI for customers as low as 1 year. Ongoing revenue comes from customers’ subscription which consists of a share of the actual energy savings the Powder Watts system generates for them via the AI and IoT ecosystem, making for happy lifetime customers that continue to save as long as they own the building. Additional substantial ongoing revenue in the future comes from the sale of high level quantifiable and verifiable carbon offsets. The Powder Watts system consists of a best in class ultra rugged IoT rooftop sensor package, a 120V or 240V utility grade energy monitoring smart switch, and a long-range hub to communicate with all devices, back to the Powder Watts Cloud. On the backend lives the Powder Watts Computer Vision AI that works to determine roof state and switching decisions for the IoT devices in the field, resulting in an approximate 92 percent energy savings for its customers, which translates to hundreds or thousands of dollars a month saved, all while dramatically improving structure protection with its constant monitoring of multiple metrics. These factors have led to Powder Watts being called the leading CleanTech company in North America. This system produces savings of similar or greater amounts of energy as a whole house solar install produces, but with a quarter to a tenth of the of the payback time. Larger homes and buildings produce 15,000-20,000kWh of savings for 5 to 6 months a year. And zero off-season energy and emissions, eliminating systems accidentally running in non snow months, thereby achieving the gold standard in quantifiable and verifiable offsets and sustainability for corporations and conscientious building owners alike. Last Earth Day, Powder Watts put out the challenge to identify another energy saving solution that went from 0 to 92 percent in the first iteration. The invention of the LED lightbulb was cited as a comparator, but time from incandescent to the approx. 85 to 92 percent LED savings was over 100 years.

Ohanae Web3 equity crowdfunding and trading platform is analogous to an electric car vs. a petrol-powered car. Our platform uses innovative Web3 technology and a regulatory framework modeled after the SEC Statement on “Custody of Digital Asset Securities by Special Purpose Broker-Dealers”. Similar to how electric cars use batteries and electric motors instead of combustion engines (the incumbents), we are confident that our platform will provide investors with a more efficient and transparent way to invest in private companies, and, subsequently, trade assets via the ATS. Ohanae Securities LLC, (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ohanae, Inc.) is currently seeking approval from FINRA to qualify as a special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) performing broker-dealer functions with respect to digital asset securities – including maintenance and custody of these assets – in a manner that addresses the unique attributes of digital asset securities while minimizing risk to investors and other market participants. Ohanae Securities will limit its business to digital asset securities to isolate risk adopting policies and procedures to, among other things, assess a given digital asset security’s distributed ledger technology and protect the private keys necessary to transfer the digital asset security. Ohanae is launching a Regulation A+ offering of Class B common stock which, will be offered—for $5.00 per share (the “Offering”). The Offering is being conducted on a “best-efforts” basis, with a maximum amount of $30 million, and it will be open one year from the date of qualification, unless the Company raises the amount sooner.
