It can drive 2-2.5% improvement via identifiable source of data, non-tampered documents and cost-reduction (& improved cash flows by 25-60 days) due to avoidance of repeated validation of same documents as loans change hands from origination to securitization.  Mortgage origination is highly inefficient as it changes hands from originator/broker, to the warehousing bank, to investors, the servicers, to the agencies (Freddie/Fannie) & increasingly the Hedge Funds. The same mortgage documents are subject to repeated appraisals, underwriting and validations due to lack of security, trust in the system, and inadequate understanding of exact composition of loans. This entails duplicative costs, stuck cash-flows and a system based on distrust across the chain. Moreover,  homes gets refinanced every 3.6years (av.) but only 18% of borrowers go to the same lender  - poor customer retention across entire home-mortgage ecosystem. We run the entire loan origination documentation on blockchain making the platform the source of immutable & undeniable provenance for all mortgage documents. This  makes the loan process quicker & easier with improved borrower retention by 3X,  reduces time of closure on refinance, reduces duplicative costs and releases cash-flows for lenders in selling their loans to the investors, who in turn can convert loan pools faster and cheaper into mortgage backed securities (MBS),  traded by secondary market players. This helps manage rate-risks and market-risks more efficiently across the mortgage chain.

AgriEID,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/agrieid,2018-01-01,year,Software,"Phoenix, Arizona, United States",AgriEID is the leader in digital livestock management with an integrated heavy duty hardware and low cost mobile cloud software solution.,"305,687",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://www.agrieid.com,https://twitter.com/agrieid,,"AgriEID is the fastest growing cloud and mobile software company in this sector with an exponential growth rate of 10-15% per month since launch. 5,000+ livestock producers use AgriEID market leading integrated EID hardware and software technology with AgriEID customers located around the world in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, and the European Union. The problem we solve : It is challenging today for small to medium sized livestock producers to collect and record accurate data on their animals and then act on that data to improve the profitability of their operation and health care for their animals. Our mission : Improve animal welfare and farmer profitability through an affordable and easy to use integrated hardware and software management solution.  To make it easy and inexpensive for livestock farmers to collect and understand their animals important data metrics and make smart educated decisions so their ranches can grow and flourish. To assist small to medium sized grass-fed livestock producers compete against large industrial producers who use factory farming technology to mass produce meat using hormones, steroids, antibiotics and processed feeds with no concern for animal welfare and provenance. Assist Livestock Farmers : ✓ Confidently build their dreams ✓ Grow to provide more jobs and support their community ✓ Share their values without fear ✓ Stop struggling and start growing Why is AgriEID so much less expensive ? ✓ We are 100% online so no sales commissions are paid to the traditional rural store networks ✓ We do not employ a team of expensive field sales reps ✓ We are 100% private so we don't have to pay dividends to shareholders ✓ We reinvest 100% of our profits back into the business to offer increasing value to our customers We are focused on growing our strong network of loyal customers and we understand that price is an important consideration for all hardworking folks living on the land. The AgriEID Story : For years we struggled to grow our cattle operation because there was no affordable computer system that allowed us to track and measure our livestock performance and profitability over time. Not even the established complicated and expensive solutions available on the market provided anywhere near the functionality and ease of use required to run a small to medium sized operation efficiently in 2022. This is WHY our local team has worked so hard over many years to design and build a better system which is now known as the AgriEID Digital Ranch System. We are revolutionising the grass fed livestock industry by making it effortless to collect animal data and act on it with the most advanced analytics tools available on any device - mobile, tablet and desktop. If you currently rely on best guestimates and crave the important data points required to grow your livestock business - then AgriEID is going to be the integrated solution you have been searching for over the years. Stop guessing and start using a system built from the ground up by cattle ranchers for small to medium sized producers. Large commercial ranchers have been using sophisticated EID digital systems and livestock management software for years to maximise operating efficiency and profitability. These legacy livestock management systems are cumbersome, outdated, expensive and require extensive product training, installation and ongoing technology support services. AgriEID combines low cost hardware (RFID Ear Tag Readers and Digital Weigh Scales) with a powerful cloud based Software platform that delivers a comprehensive and affordable livestock management solution direct to your iPad or tablet as you work on animals in real-time.

This creates a very low barrier to entry and eliminates awkward conversations about signing up for a new card together - plus they don't want to do that anyway. Couples set up a default split % for all of their shared expenses that they can adjust on a per transaction basis if they want.  Users swipe which expenses they want to move from their private view to the couples shared view.  Smoov keeps track of the total damage (who owes who how much) and whenever the couple is ready, they can settle up via direct ACH transfer through Smoov. Why?

We believe that the CRM of the future is relationship-centric and should be built on top of a different set of assumptions: - It should be about relationships, not sales pipelines. Focus and priority are on the relationship with the person or organization. - It should encourage you to stay in touch with your valuable relationships. - It should not require an army of consultants to get started. It should be user-friendly and straightforward to use. - Relationships don't happen when you sit behind the computer. So big attention is on mobile experience of the user. - It is not for the sales department only. Other teams hold important relationships in the business and will also be using the tool.

Generally speaking, it is used as a structured method of aligning IT with business objectives and addressing compliance requirements while effectively managing risk. The benefits of a well-planned GRC strategy can be many, including better management, improved decision-making, and better IT investments. Global governance, risk management, and compliance encompass a wide range of disciplines. In this context, enterprise security and risk mitigation play a critical role, even though every discipline has its own priorities. Large numbers of companies are building security solutions from digital to physical in order to protect enterprises, secure their data and infrastructure, and meet compliance goals. GRC is more than a collection of software tools, despite the number of good options available to streamline it. Rather than creating a GRC function from scratch, many organizations consult a framework for guidance on how to develop and refine it. Having the right security tools, solutions, and service providers means combating the right threat and aligning perfectly with compliance. This is where GRC Viewpoint magazine can help businesses identify the most innovative security and compliance providers to fit the unique needs of each business. Research at our firm involves hours and hours spent investigating the companies in the governance, risk and compliance space that have an edge in developing innovative solutions. An innovative team of industry veterans, editors, and cybersecurity specialists at GRC Viewpoint Magazine are continually exploring the latest and best security solutions available in the market, so you can save time and money trying to find the right partner.
