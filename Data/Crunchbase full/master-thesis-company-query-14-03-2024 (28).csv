That is potentially $165B or $500 per taxpayer lost to fraud. 2. Proactive data monitoring and analysis is used by only 30% of government organizations for anti-fraud controls. ThirdLine technology solves these problems by analyzing all municipality transactions and workflow processes with 400 analytics, machine learning, and ai.

The holding company’s name is Now Technologies, Inc., and is incorporated in Delaware. The corporate website is https://www.nowtechnologiesinc.com. Doing business as StylizeNOW, our platform provides on-demand services that cater to customers’ residences. For now, the platform focuses on salon services; haircuts, hair coloring, nail services, and eyelash care. StylizeNow contracts with licensed professionals that agree to provide these services to customers that use the StylizeNow mobile application. Similar to other on-demand service providers, our company does not employ these professionals but contracts with individual professionals that provide these services and send them to customers that use our platform. This platform specifically is not an online marketplace but an on-demand service. Customers simply go on our platform and select what service they desire, and our platform will immediately begin to set them up with a provider and send this provider to their homes. We feel that given the extraordinary times we live in, coupled with the rise in sharing services and the git economy, not to mention that a lot of the professionals in these fields are currently out of work, due to shutdowns, that the times leave open a promising opportunity to allow customers to avoid the hazards of going inside an indoor public space with dozens or even hundreds of people. Also, our platform allows these professionals to continue earning money while the shutdowns continue. We hope that it will catch on and eventually we can expand beyond merely salon services to other industries and customers will continue to like the service even after the end of the shutdowns and we return to normal activity. Our platform is currently available to customers in the San Antonio and Austin metro areas with the goal of expanding if business allows. We eventually hope to expand statewide and afterward nationally.
