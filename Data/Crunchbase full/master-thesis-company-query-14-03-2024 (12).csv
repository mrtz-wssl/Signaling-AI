We measure shape WITHOUT measuring area or volume – we can even measure left- vs. right-handedness. Geometry has waited 5,000 years for this. One of the biggest pain points for even the best radiologist is that they are not as accurate at 3pm as they are at 8am, because of mental exhaustion. The refined numbers from ShapeGenie will boost a radiologist or surgeon’s diagnostic intuition by 1,000X. Furthermore, the refined numbers will allow users to create machine learning models based on the measurements that they routinely make when diagnosing disease or assessing a candidate for surgery.   In pharma and biotech, AI has reached an accuracy plateau for MRI/CT image analysis because volume and area produce very noisy data.

Their engineers have developed sophisticated techniques to predict upcoming signal states. Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format.",https://www.facebook.com/Connected-Signals-152962808055458/,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Platforms, Software, Transportation",2,"Matt Ginsberg, Ravindra Kondagunta",1-10,10,Private Equity,2020-12-27,,,,Convertible Note,,,,Private Equity,2492199,USD,2492199,2792199,USD,2792199,"Benhamou Global Ventures, Toyota Ventures, Plug and Play, Tech Coast Angels, Sand Hill Angels",2,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,29,4,5,17,0,1,,"Transport, packaging and storing",,,

Litter is an enormous problem. The presence of litter in a neighborhood suppresses property values, decreases foot traffic and commercial activity, and negatively impacts mental health; all this in addition to just being an all around environmental pollutant and eyesore.   We're achieving this by designing a modular system. The robot provides the physical sensors and actuators, we implement an autonomy software module to govern its behavior corresponding with its use-case, and we attach a tool for a specific mission. For our short-term plan, we are developing a robot that can navigate safely along a commercial corridor sidewalk while pulling a power sweeper. While our first target is combating litter, this modular approach with a focus on outdoor navigation allows for this robot to be used in numerous other cases. Swap out the power sweeper for a lawn mower or seeder and you can do largescale lawncare. Add in a painting attachment and you can paint lines on a set of athletic fields and take care of all their landscaping needs.

Notiphy collects data in ways paper cannot allowing management to improve outcomes related to employees, workflow, and jobs. Having this accurate data, management can make educated decisions and know where opportunities are to reduce costs and improve profitability. Finally, the platform is very flexible and configurable allowing management to define the processes and inputs workers need to record so it can solve any pain point inside the workflow or help the entire workflow.    Notiphy is also effective in helping management and workers during this changing environment.  Notiphy can help companies do more with fewer people by giving workers on the floor access to information and messages from management, the ability to input information, ways to alert others if they need assistance and providing the data necessary to manage costs. Workers can better maintain social distancing by not having to leave their workstation to seek assistance and the environment can be more contactless as you can greatly reduce the touching of common paper and job jackets.",https://www.facebook.com/notiphy/,"Greater Chicago Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Software",1,Bob Wise,1-10,3,Seed,2020-10-01,600000,USD,600000,Seed,600000,USD,600000,Seed,1610000,USD,1610000,1610000,USD,1610000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,1,,,0,1,,Scientific and technological services,,,

However, we strongly believe that there is an opportunity to rethink this matter. Yornest offers a fresh approach to how mass communication is handled for member-based communities. Say goodbye to the old-fashioned, one-size-fits-all approach and embrace a new era of streamlined, efficient, and engaging communication. Traditional SMS & email channels for member-based communities is a one-sided conversation that often inundates users with generic messages, leaving them feeling disconnected and bombarded. At Yornest, we believe in a more meaningful approach. Our innovative community communication app empowers community managers to transform SMS & emails marketing into a two-way dialogue. Imagine sending SMS or email alerts that not only convey your message but also drive the recipients to engage in a community feed where they can discuss, ask questions, and share their thoughts in real-time. It's time to bid farewell to one-way SMS & email blasts and embrace a more interactive and engaging communication method that fosters genuine connections. At Yornest, we deeply appreciate that the vitality of any community is intricately linked to the quality of its interactions and conversations. This profound understanding has led us to revolutionize the way community managers harness the potential of SMS and email channels as a means of communication, seamlessly integrating them into a dynamic community feed. Unlike traditional approaches, our community feed transcends being a mere one-way communication tool; it serves as the pulsating epicenter of engagement. Our innovative platform empowers users to leverage posts from the feed as text alerts or emails, effectively transforming every interaction into an opportunity for fostering meaningful dialogue.

We were also featured as one of the technologies to watch in 2022 by the Economist as well as 2023 Advanced Manufacturing Start-Up Technology Award Runner-Up.    Our ultimate vision is to build an on-demand personalized tissue manufacturing platform that would be a one-stop shop for bioprinted tissues and organs; and, hence, to cut barriers to medical treatment for millions.    A.D.A.M. is pioneering a service model, where the turnkey system will be installed and maintained by A.D.A.M. at the hospital for a monthly subscription fee.

All of this is done in the name of protecting data. But, once files are moved, shared, or stolen, the data is no longer protected. Even worse, these controls get in the way and frustrate business users to the point they intentionally work around them. Anchor inverts the equation by baking protection into the data, invisible to the business users (like antivirus), so that files are free to travel and security is out of the way. Simply put, wherever the data goes, it is protected. Anchor is a SaaS platform, with an endpoint component, that bakes protection into your files with a unique transparent combination of encryption, continuous multi-factor access controls, and a digital chain of custody. And when you do share or collaborate, Anchor protection stays with your data, even when it leaves your organization. Anchor empowers you to maintain control of your files while collaborating on premise or in the cloud, including forensic logging and revoking access. In under 90 minutes, Anchor is fully deployed and empowers your business users to securely work and collaborate without complicated security products or rules in the way. All without requiring you to change existing IT controls or how your users and applications work today. DAtAnchor is a result of a multi-year research activity, developed at Ohio State University.
