Tuvoli,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tuvoli,2019-01-01,year,,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",Get business done anytime from anywhere on your phone or desktop.,"255,339",,Active,,,,,For Profit,http://www.tuvoli.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tuvoli/,"First and foremost, Tuvoli is a business to business platform. Tuvoli connects brokers (and operators who broker) to suppliers in a fast, efficient, and secure manner. We have built native mobile apps for iOS and Android that promise to let brokers and operators do business anytime, from anywhere. We believe that improving connectivity and leveling the playing field is in everyone's best interest. We need to work together to improve the quality of our product at the industry level, because that is the path to success for us all. Tuvoli has pre-loaded the jet aircraft in the US air charter fleet onto its platform from data published by the FAA. That means that for most charter companies, signing up is as simple as verifying their company and aircraft info. Our team is standing by to assist at any time along the way. Brokers will go through a verification process that may include a request for references. Once on the platform, operators will benefit immediately from free fleet flight tracking. Aircraft in your fleet are displayed on a US map that is updated in real-time. Flight strips provide information on the last flight and up-to-date information on any aircraft that are in the air. Searching for supply or demand begins with entering a point of origin. Our itinerary builder will show you the closest airports to any street address or place name, making it a simple matter to find the closest airport for your customer. Sourcing aircraft is fast and easy. You can select one or more aircraft in the search results and send out requests for quotes in a matter of seconds. Operators can respond to quotes on their desktops or mobile phones, with just a few clicks or taps. One of our truly game-changing features is our built in payment capability. We establish a no-fee FDIC insured bank account for every Tuvoli user (company). From there, our platform facilitates funds transfer between any two parties 24/7/365. We eliminate the risk of ACH fraud because we vette every company before they are allowed to transact on the platform. In addition to the ability to move money, we are introducing the concept of the guaranteed payment for air charter flights. We have been in the industry for decades, and we are quite familiar with the problems we all face. Operators are often waiting for a broker to wire, right down to the wire, or they are accepting a credit card hold, crossing their fingers that the funds will come through. On the other hand, there are plenty of cases where a broker has pre-paid for a trip only to have the aircraft become unavailable at the last minute. Our solution provides for the buyer (broker) to put the funds into a segregated staging account between the time the trip is confirmed and departure time of the flight. The funds are guaranteed to not move from that account until the trip is completed (or cancelled). Once a trip is complete funds can be moved in a matter of minutes (seconds really), and they can be moved any time of day, any day of the year. To sum it up, we believe that for our industry to grow, we have to change. We have to build faster, more secure payment systems, and a layer of connectivity between industry players that can support a faster, more consistent, more reliable product for charter consumers. We hope you'll join us on our quest to grow the air charter industry from the inside out.",,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,-32.99%,,1,,,,,,,,,

In 2015 Baltimore, Maryland-based federal contractor Tidewater, Inc  was looking for an automation solution to help them manage 650 vendors and thousands of monthly invoices. After researching products in the market, they realized that most were just too big, too expensive, or put far too much burden of implementation on their small AP team. They wanted a solution that would not only help them to stem the growth of their AP department, but something that would enhance communication with their vendors. Prasad Dissanayake, President of Tidewater and engineer by profession, tapped friend and software engineer, Dimuthu Roshan, in Sri Lanka to recruit a development team to build what would eventually become PaperTrl. In less than one year the software transformed the Tidewater AP function. Payback came quickly as Tidewater saw huge increases in AP efficiencies. Due to its popularity among users and vendors, Tidewater decided to commercialize PaperTrl. Prasad chose software industry veteran Steve Weber as CEO. Steve had spent most of his career leading software companies that were focused on developing, marketing and supporting integration solutions for ERP and accounting software. As such he came with many years’ experience in the Intuit, SAGE, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, and SAP communities. Shilpa Marano joined the team as COO having worked with Steve at integration startup nChannel and IBM Sterling Commerce. Shilpa brought years of experience building successful marketing and product teams.
