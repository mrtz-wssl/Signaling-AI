You’ve seen the stats and the data. You know that when patients and their parents have access to proper support and education they are more engaged, more prepared, and more likely to return to your facility. But with limited budget, limited time, and already over-extended staff, it’s impossible for child life specialists engage all the children and families who walk through your facility’s doors. Until now. Our HIPAA-compliant platform ensures that child life services are reaching every family who walks through your facility - without putting more strain on staff. This customizable mobile app expand child life services by: 1. Supporting staff and families: By providing on-demand access to child life resources through the app. Staff can more easily connect families with child life services, while families can receive immediate support and guidance when they need it. 2. Providing equitable care: The app can help ensure that all patients and families have access to high-quality child life services, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. CLOC can help provide more equitable care and reduce disparities in care. 3. Ensuring patient privacy: The HIPAA-compliant Child Life On Call app was developed with these principles in mind to ensure that patient data is handled responsibly and ethically. 4.

Concept The Pitch Place is here to make freelance journalism a whole lot easier. Our goal is to enable media professionals around the world with the connections they need to tell the stories that matter. In a world where journalists are often taking physical and/or financial risks to work in the field they love as freelancers, the Pitch Place is working to try and reduce those risks every way we can. We are creating a network of media professionals -- including editors, content producers, writers, photographers, videographers, fixers, translators, and experts -- so that: - when breaking news happens, media outlets can easily locate the best freelance talent they need to cover the story immediately - freelancers can pitch story ideas efficiently, based on their expertise and qualifications - editors only receive alerts to story ideas that match their criteria - community standards on pricing, fairness, and copyright are met and respected - journalists know they are working with professionals with a proven track record in the industry - getting paid for a job well done is standard policy - finding the right journalism job for you is a click away How does it work: In each of the following sections, media professionals can connect with each other, agree on the terms of a job, and, once completed, pay and get paid for a job well done. Pitches The Pitch Place is a like a dating service for journalists and editors: each fill out their profile and when a pitch is posted only those who are a match for each other will get an email alert about the details of the pitch. Meanwhile, the teaser and title of the pitch are posted in the community Pitch feed for all registered members to see. Grants, fellowships, awards, events, and PR announcements are also posted on this feed and members can filter the feed to suite their needs. Jobs Journalism jobs, contract positions, freelance gigs -- anything that requires hiring the skills of a media professional are listed on our community Jobs feed. People Members of the Pitch Place are media professionals in the field; the story-tellers; the photojournalists; the writers of history in the making; those capturing life's events in the moment; and the content producers and editors in charge of the gateways reaching the public eye.",https://www.facebook.com/thepitchplace,"Washington DC Metro Area, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services",1,Philippe Bregeon,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,

Grandhi began his business journey as the child of an entrepreneurial family in the South Indian village of Rajam, in the state of Andhra Pradesh. As he grew up, Grandhi was frequently exposed to the ins and outs of running a business, managing finances, and preparing a business for growth. After graduating college, Grandhi started working in finance at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in India. Later, he moved to the U.S. to take a position with SunEdison, a major renewable energy company, and eventually held roles in the financial departments at both Amazon and Starbucks. It was during his time with these major corporations—companies that had both the staff and the resources to implement complex financial and tax-saving strategies—that Grandhi developed the vision of starting his own financial firm. The mission of what would become AG FinTax would be to share the same best industry practices that Fortune 100 companies were using to grow, with small business owners, helping them increase their revenue and profits. In 2019, Grandhi founded the Seattle-headquartered AG FinTax to provide expertise and guidance to entrepreneurs and small businesses on tax planning, CFO services, wealth management, and financial outlooks. Supported by a professional team of CPAs, Chartered Accountants, and CMAs, Grandhi and AG FinTax offer advisory services always guided by the core values of integrity, accountability, and value addition. Since the pandemic began, AG FinTax has worked especially hard to support those businesses suffering from the economic downturn. Grandhi and his team helped many clients get the help they needed through SBA loans and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Now that the PPP funds are exhausted, Grandhi and his team have shifted to helping PPP loan recipients achieve the maximum amount of loan forgiveness possible.",https://www.facebook.com/agfintax,"Greater Seattle Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Real Estate, Travel and Tourism",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-29.03%,27,,,,,,,,,,
