According to research, the global market for UTM services is estimated to be worth 517 million USD between 2018 and 2022. As the drone industry continues to boom, the number of drones in the air is expected to increase exponentially over the coming years. Left unchecked, these drones present a serious threat to manned aviation so safe integration of drone traffic with existing manned air traffic is an absolute necessity. Unifly’s award-winning UTM platform is available on the market today as a mature software product that can be configured to suit the stakeholders’ needs. It connects official entities with operators to integrate drones into the airspace safely and securely. The Unifly platform allows drone pilots to check the legal status of their flight and allows authorities to monitor and manage drone traffic in their airspace. Unifly’s (UTM) platform is already in use today by the national authorities of Germany, Denmark, Austria and Belgium. Recognizing the value of collaboration, Unifly is an active participant in several leading European drone projects. Unifly is a global company. It is active in the US (LAANC certified). Unifly also deployed the first UTM system in Africa to support UNICEF’s drone corridor in Malawi. In Asia, the company provides the technical UTM backbone to ensure safe drone flights at the Fukushima Robot Test Field centre. Unifly as a company was founded in 2015 by a number of aerospace experts. Already in 2012, a team of air traffic controllers, pilots and engineers shared a vision of developing a system that would allow them to manage and track the growing number of drones flying in the air and to easily contact the drone operator if needed.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite an abundance of big data software options, there is pent-up demand for secure raw data sharing within and across organizations - for analytics, workflows and apps.  Breaches demonstrate that users cannot be trusted, so platforms must be.   The current approach, organized around a centralized one-owner “trusted user” role-based security model is 50 years old.   Organizations worldwide operate no longer operate in a centralized one-owner world anymore.  We live in a hyperconnected world, with multiple data owners, and regulations which are driving toward decentralized individual ownership of data.   Myngl.IO delivers a hardened decentralized zero-trust multi-owner “platform” on which to do analytics and deploy microservice based functionality to data from multiple owners to be securely commingled for analytic driven microservices-based apps, workflows, collaboration and automation spanning organizations.

Our main mission is to provide the users with a chance to meet the people they’ve come across. Most of the existing dating apps fail to solve the “expectation vs reality” problem. The user pics on a suppositive Tinder or Badoo are far from reality. We’ve decided to go obverse and allow the user to first meet somebody in real life and then find them on the app. Girls, just like in real life, have significant advantages which is how we deal with gender inequality that other dating services have.  The technical solution is based on a smart geolocation filtering system. The system allows for quick and precise identification of the real-life encounters, as well as showing them in the app in the most informative way.  The user experience is based around a map and their bumps on it, while in real-time​, a user can see on a map who, where, when and how many times they’ve bumped into. Or just watch the bump history in the list any time.

My name is Sarah and I am excited to share with you my experience as a senior manager at a bidet converter kit company in Nevada. With over four years of experience in the industry, I have gained significant knowledge and perspective on the importance of personal hygiene and the benefits of using a bidet. Bidet converter kits are an innovative solution designed to help individuals maintain personal hygiene while also reducing environmental waste. In simple terms, a bidet converter kit is a device that attaches to your existing toilet and provides a cleansing solution aimed at keeping you clean and fresh throughout the day. Unlike traditional toilet paper, bidet converter kits use water to cleanse, reducing the risk of irritation and keeping you cleaner for longer. As a senior manager at this company, I have witnessed the increasing demand for bidet converter kits as people become more environmentally conscious and health-conscious. In addition to its environmental benefits, bidet usage has also been linked to reduced risks of urinary tract infections and hemorrhoids. At our company, we are committed to providing top-quality bidet converter kits to our clients while also advocating for better hygiene practices. Our team of experts work tirelessly to ensure that our clients get the best possible experience by providing comprehensive installation guides and superior customer support. In conclusion, bidet converter kits offer a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution to personal hygiene. If you are looking to improve your hygiene practices and reduce your environmental footprint, consider investing in a bidet converter kit from a reputable company like ours. Together, we can create a healthier and sustainable future.",,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other, Social Impact",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,
