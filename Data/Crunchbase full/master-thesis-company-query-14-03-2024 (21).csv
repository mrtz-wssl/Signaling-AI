Companies that were poised to making moves in their respective industries. Companies that were growing through multiple growth identifiers that we have seen when using sales intelligence platforms like Lead411. These indicators came from a number of different sources including; hiring trends, recent funding, executive hires, and more. As we started to look into this data and began to understand the growth trends associated, we thought we could take it one step further. Growjo is intended to identify growing companies sure, but what we found out when devising our algorithm was that Growjo could actually identify companies that were poised for ongoing and future growth as well. Our algorithm isn’t about just a few indicators like revenue or total employees, it’s about finding trends in multiple data points, predicting growth and presenting that data in a useful and consumable way. There are other B2B lists out there, inc 5000 and forbes 500 come to mind, and companies can certainly apply for these types of recognition lists, but Growjo is different. No submissions required, and we don’t include companies that are over 1000 employees already. (The recognition of companies that are on their way up toward over 1000 employees seemed more appealing then highlighting the Microsoft’s and Exxon Mobil’s of the world.) We also offer a downloadable .csv file of the companies free of charge, and we recognize each company with unique badges they can utilize on their website, scripted social sharing options and PR templates so it is extremely easy to promote your rank.

In it, I wanted to know the following: What did he believe to be most important in life? If he could’ve gone back in time and spoken with his 20-year-old self, what would he say? Did he have any regrets? It was important for me to understand the world as he saw it; to learn from his successes, his mistakes, and potentially save myself from making some of my own. I wanted to see life through his eyes, if only for a moment. I wanted to capture his words — his memories. I wanted to remember his stories as if they were my own to share, and help them live on from generation to generation. Unfortunately, I never received that letter. The wisdom I had so longed to capture from my grandfather passed away alongside him. Years later, leading up to my wedding day, I requested the same of other elders in my family, hoping to make up for prior opportunities lost. But again, I was left letter-less. It was around this time that the idea for Heirloom first came to mind. With all of the technology and connectivity available to us in the world, there had to be an easier, more formalized way of documenting the experiences of our loved ones. There had to be an easier way of preserving and sharing their words long after their physical time in this world had come and gone. And now, there is. It’s easy to attach value to things; to want for nothing, buy just about any product you can imagine from the comfort of your couch, and feel instantly gratified.

We uniquely address the largest unmet need in CSF Management; the high rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt occlusion. VP shunts fail at a rate of 50% within 2 years and 80% within 5 years, contributing to repeat revision brain surgeries (each costing upwards of $40,000).  Conceptualized in 2014 in collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and spun out of Alcyone Therapeutics in 2018, Anuncia’s patented portfolio of technologies provide peace-of-mind through innovation to improve daily quality of life for the millions of underserved patients with hydrocephalus and other CSF disorders and their families, who suffer from the clinical, economic, and emotional burden of repeat revision brain surgery due to VP shunt occlusions. Anuncia’s core platform has an elegant mechanism of action using a simple finger depression of a soft silicone dome located under the patient’s scalp to produce a noninvasive, retrograde flush of the patient’s own CSF to restore flow through an occluded catheter and prevent emergency surgery. ReFlow’s initial clinical evidence of flow restoration and reduction of symptoms via acute intervention flushing with follow-up up to 3 years, led neurosurgeons to evaluate ReFlow for prophylactic occlusion prevention in their high-risk patients. Ground-breaking clinical data, now out up to 2 years with 100% success, suggest ReFlow is safe for at-home, prophylactic flushing by patients or caregivers to extend shunt life and eliminate revision brain surgery. Supported by these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ReFlow Breakthrough Device status in 2021, making it eligible for regulatory and reimbursement advantages. With existing profitable reimbursement, Anuncia plans to launch its next-generation ReFlow Mini product line in Q2 2022 and continue clinical studies to support market adoption and premium reimbursement.  With Breakthrough status and strong health economic advantages to improve hospital quality metrics and support New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for rapid market adoption and premium pricing; Anuncia is positioned to be the leader in CSF management and help patients live fuller lives.  ReFlow’s unique ability to improve patient access to noninvasive lifesaving therapy at home or in the clinic and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs, earned it an Honorable Mention in the Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards and landed it on MDDI’s The Ultimate List of Private Companies to Watch.",https://www.facebook.com/AnunciaInc,"Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Elsa Chi Abruzzo, PJ Anand",11-50,2,Seed,2023-10-20,1000,USD,1000,Seed,1000,USD,1000,Seed,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,Arizona Tech Investors,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,6,0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,Medical apparatus and instruments,,,

Most common conditions, from a UTI to pinkeye, are diagnosed by answering a few simple questions. SupDoc allows you to answer the short list of questions any doctor would ask you at an in-person visit without the need for scheduling an appointment and traveling to a clinic.  We have partnerships with a curated team of award-winning, board-certified, local physicians who have seen it all. All it takes to get a diagnosis and treatment plan from one of our doctors is to select your answers to a few standard questions. We also offer a more open-ended diagnosis process that gives you the freedom to put your concerns in your own words.  Once you submit your information through our HIPAA-compliant messaging service, one of our doctors will review your symptoms and propose a treatment plan within a few hours. If medicine is part of your treatment plan, the prescription will be sent directly to your pharmacy.  Each visit is $50, which includes unlimited free follow up questions. If the doctor can't provide a treatment, you won't be charged. If your treatment plan calls for a prescription, filling it will be covered by your insurance just like a traditional in-person visit.",https://www.facebook.com/supdoctwincities/,"Greater Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health Care,1,Michael Brombach,1-10,1,M&A,2020-04-01,350000,USD,350000,Undisclosed,350000,USD,350000,Undisclosed,350000,USD,350000,350000,USD,350000,,,,,Was Acquired,2021-05-20,day,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24,1,,,,,,,,,
