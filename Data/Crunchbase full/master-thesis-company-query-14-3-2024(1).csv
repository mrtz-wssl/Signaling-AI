Our predictive prep recommendations can save restaurants money on labor and minimize food waste, all while increasing productivity and profitability. By automating the manual process of determining what to prep each day, restaurants can focus on providing quality service to their customers. Our Story With a shared recognition of the long-unaddressed needs of restaurant operators, Matt and Osa co-founded ClearCOGS. Both Matt and Osa have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and pressures faced by restaurants and are dedicated to using their knowledge and expertise to support and empower individuals in the industry. ​ Matt's journey as a restaurant owner was not an easy one.  At just 21 years old, he was given the opportunity to buy a struggling sandwich shop.  The AC was out, you smell that the grease trap hadn't been cleaned in months, no staff, ice buckets on the equipment compressors to keep them from overheating, the list went on and on.  Despite these challenges, Matt worked tirelessly to turn the business around. He put in long, grueling hours and sacrificed his own well-being to get the restaurant back on track and went on to open and operate multiple more locations. Having put in the long, grueling hours and sacrifices required to run a successful restaurant, he knew that there had to be a better way.    That's where Osa enters the scene. Osa, originally from Nigeria, moved to Indiana at the age of 18 to study Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in Champaign (Matt's hometown).  After completing his Masters in Computer Engineering and working for a few years in Silicon Valley, Osa launched his first startup, where he met Matt.  After selling his startup to one of their largest customers, Osa co-founded Fifth Star Funds, a nonprofit venture capital firm focused on investing in minority-led companies in the Chicago region. ​ It wasn't until Matt dove into the world of programming and data science that the idea for ClearCOGS was born.  What started as a project between Osa & Matt to reduce food waste quickly turned into the restaurant industry's first AI operations manager.    Now, ClearCOGS acts as a translator between complex machine learning and the needs of restaurant managers, providing real-time answers to the everyday questions faced by restaurants.  Together, Matt and Osa are dedicated to helping restaurants streamline their operations, reduce their costs, and increase their profits.",https://www.facebook.com/ClearCOGS/,"Greater Philadelphia Area, Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Matthew Wampler, Osayanmo Osarenkhoe",11-50,2,Seed,2022-07-27,950000,USD,950000,Seed,950000,USD,950000,Seed,950000,USD,950000,950000,USD,950000,"MATH Venture Partners, CIC Angels",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-18,,,-4.33%,6,,,,,,,,,,
