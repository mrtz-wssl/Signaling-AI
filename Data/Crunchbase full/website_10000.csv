Four barriers to entry artificially restrict the recreational boat market: Safety. In 2020, 767 people were killed and 3,191 were injured while on a recreational boat. That’s 2x more per-outing than skydiving. Hassle. The hassle of boating is often far greater than the hours on the water—prompting timeless quotes like, “The best boat is a friend’s boat”. Expertise. Lack of knowledge combined with fear of specific tasks (like docking and undocking) hinders adoption. Expense. Current operating costs include $400 per day in fuel plus unplanned maintenance, annual winterizing and de-winterizing, and marina-related expenses. We are starting from scratch and rethinking the way modern software, sensors, and control systems can (and should) change things to make boating easier, safer, and more accessible for all. AllOY is building a boat that docks itself, a boat that avoids other boats, a boat with a reimagined helm, a boat with an industry-leading EV powertrain and battery, and a boat that gets smarter over time. Our team includes a veteran founder with exits to broadcast com / Yahoo! and Gaylord Entertainment (Cotter), Co-founder & CTO, former Toyota Mobility CPO (Kinney), and board member, former MasterCraft CEO (Dorton).  Special note, co-founder & CTO, Dr. Kinney helped build the hardware and software solution that enabled his underdog, four-member team to successfully finish the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, a 130-mile, autonomous vehicle race across the desert.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,3.0,1-10,Private,,,0.0,0.0,,6,2,2021,49045,False,False

Nearly all solid cancers grow faster than their blood supply, leading to regions of low oxygen in the tumors and HIF activation. The HIFs in turn induce the expression of over 100 genes that help tumor cells survive and spread. OncoSpherix has several classes of small molecules that block activation of HIF-1 through novel mechanisms. OncoSpherix’s lead clinical candiate has been shown in mouse models to reduce primary tumor growth, inhibit metastases, and prolong survival in many types of cancer (glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, uveal melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer).

Many budgeting websites show you if you have blown through your budget. We take it a step further.
