(the “CAR INC”) is a FinTech company driven to plug the gaps in the crypto market and bridge the governance institutions with the existing and new thought leaders of the crypto industry.The crypto industry holds invaluable opportunities towards exponential economic growth through financial inclusion and participation of the masses. A new world is being born out of the reinvention of the financial systems built on unprecedented technological advances. And the Company is already in play to reap the benefits for its investors. As complex as the Company’s products and expertise are, the business model is simple, sustainable and highly profitable. All offered services are for profit—subscription-based models but are customized to each product line. This hedges the Company’s risk and also allows for identification of the most profitable revenue model, with the flexibility of replicating it. The Company has the experts and has developed unparalleled crypto market solutions. Now, the Company is rapidly acquiring customers. With a comprehensive Go-To-Market plan and an exhaustive Marketing strategy already in play, the Company has leveraged its technical expertise towards data analyses and automation to allow its subject experts to continuously innovate them using machine learning algorithms. The Company already has exciting products in the pipeline: Crypto Index, Crypto Sovereign and ETF Rating platforms, and more. In parallel, it also has a geographic expansion strategy in place—furthering financial inclusion. The Company’s leadership is made of technology and finance leaders with a combined experience of 200+ years—in entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. And the Company’s team is first and foremost passionate about Blockchain technology and its applications. We are the only ones in the industry with such holistic product offerings built on total compliance. It is exciting to bring our solutions and structure to this nascent industry and are confident that it will soon be shaping governmental and institutional policies. The Company is destined to be a change leader and wants you to join this exhilarating journey. We have developed solutions to resolve the four key challenges of the crypto industry: 1. Minimal Regulatory Oversight: Crypto Asset Rating Platform (CARP), an Independent Structured Rating Agency, comprehensively rate crypto assets for Institutional and Retail Clients. The Company developed custom rating algorithm to conduct an exhaustive multi-layered evaluation across 125 parameters from 15 categories and appraisal against four distinct risk buckets—business, financial, legal and technology. 2. Illiquid Asset Market: Tokenization Asset Platform (TAP) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) tokenization platform that offers the process of creating, issuing, managing and converting an asset to digital securities programmatically on Blockchain in a more restrictive and compliant way by embedding the logic in Smart Contracts. TAP also allows an issuer to create securities under various jurisdictions in a compliant way with a lock period, define vesting schedules, configure transfer and selling restrictions for inside and outside the exchange in accordance with regulatory rules, investor whitelisting, perform KYC and AML checks, digital securities recovery process, provide dividend distribution of tokens and conduct a voting event for shareholders. 3. Trusted Community Deficit: The Company’s quality content knowledge platform, Crypto Business World (CBW), is the one-stop-shop for all updates in the crypto market. It integrates in-house and external content to deliver subject matter across all platforms—news and articles, videos and podcasts, analysis reports and press releases. Additionally, it incentivizes industry experts to publish verified content on CBW through its ‘Content Marketplace’ feature. Thus, a trusted community (External Analyst-EA) is being developed. The Company developed a custom profile and consensus algorithm to nurture the trusted community. 4. Lack of Knowledge: The Crypto Training Platform (CTP) aims at leveraging experts and specialists from all of the Company's products, and their knowledge, to deliver Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and learning platforms and partnerships. This platform is a personal dream of the CEO and is currently under development.",101-250,3.0,Seed,2020-10-28,92000.0,Convertible Note,317000.0,1.0,101-250,Private,,,,,,0,6,2018,15844,False,False

Deliverable,2020-06-02,http://www.deliverableapp.com,"New York, New York, United States","Apps, Information Technology, Software, Transportation","Apps, Delivery Service, Information Technology, Software",205091.0,"Company Overview: The Deliverable team has been working tirelessly to produce a mobile application for my app. Between the drivers and the mobile application engineers, we have developed a whole new niche market of “same day” delivery. In the aftermath of a pandemic, my team is dedicated to providing our consumers with the best delivery options feasible. For the first time in history, we are inventing a revolutionary idea, which promotes same-day shipping. A consumer does not have to wait for two-to-three-days for delivery anymore. With Deliverable, the item will be driven to the consumer’s door within a 60 - 90 minute window.   Pain: Given our current circumstances, in our post-COVID-19 society, no one could have imagined that consumers are not going out to the brick and mortar stores any longer. According to a recent poll, more than seventy percent of consumers are conducting their shopping online, even for personal items. Due to society’s introversion, this planted the seed for the innovative application, Deliverable, in which one does not have to leave their home to obtain everyday items, such as groceries, household items, games, furniture, antiques, and miscellaneous item. Big box companies are already speaking with Deliverable to innovate the way we ship.    Solution: Instead of the onerous task of brick and mortar shopping, Deliverable provides a mobile application for consumers to receive items in the same business day or within ninety minutes, without ever having to leave their doorstep. With the click of a few buttons. Like any delivery service, the driver does not have to make contact with the person who receives the item, which limits the interaction to the Covid-19. The delivery driver acts like a post-man, and the item will be left at one’s doorstep without ever coming face-to-face. The entire transaction is completed through cyberspace. Technology: Currently, on Deliverable financial budget, Deliverable has produced an Apple (iPad and iPhone) version of the mobile application, and our next goal is to launch the Android version, but we need more funding in order to continue to make the application accessible for all consumers. In order to promote the application, we need marketing dollars. We would like to make Deliverable a household name. With marketing dollars, we can fund the press releases, commercials, radio broadcasts, referral, SEO, SMM, etc. IP/Defensibility: My intellectual property has a patent, and I have a lawyer on the payroll. My IP is protected by our patent, and Deliverable has a patent-lawyer on speed-dial, Hugh Keefe, Esq.   Competition/Competitive Advantage:  Target, Walmart, and Offerup, each company has already stolen parts of my intellectual patent for their business’s shipping options, and they are offering “same day shipping” on their mobile application. After speaking with my lawyer, Attorney Keefe, each company must cease and desist their “same day shipping” options. If these big-box giants, partner with Deliverable, we will be driving Walmart and Target products to customer’s doorstep. Additionally, on the app, we will stimulate the pricing of products in retail, because there is a follow social feature. When someone delivers something, the price and any info gets posted on a list. When the consumer sees that price they will possibly change their buying methods. Market Size/Customers: The goal for our market size in the United States—we launch the application nationwide. Per state, Deliverable is looking, to begin with, Connecticut and New York. Subsequently, we have five drivers and are currently in a race to get 200, independent contractors, ready on stand-by, in Connecticut as soon as the app launches on Friday. Once the analytic data from Connecticut and New York goes through our Firebase cloud, with your funding we will launch nationwide. Deliverable offers customers a free-delivery, one-time free coupon, upon their registration of the mobile application.  Free delivery is one way for the application to go viral (Uber did the same tactic.) The postal market is very lucrative. If we get one percent of the national postal market, according to pre-COVID-19 numbers in 2018, USPS, FedEx, and UPS deliver over 56 million packages per day which leads to 5,400,000 packages being handled through Deliverable per day. If each delivery transaction is 20$, the daily numbers would be in the millions $108,000,000.  Business Model: The Deliverable business model is very simple: provide an excellent same-day delivery service to everyday consumers, and our goal is to transport as many items as we can per day to the appropriate destination. Also, we need to partner with as many companies as we can, so they can include us as an option at their mobile checkout. Once we are funded, we can open analytic data-centers (one in every two states) to analyze the information to make sure we do not have any downtime. Driver to Consumer collaboration will be made with the separate application that is currently underway. Milestones: As a team, we are launching a mobile application this week. Our first milestone is we found an innovative team of engineers in India, to maintain our budget, who is currently working on finalizing the mobile application.  We fulfilled our quota for drivers in New York and Connecticut. Financial: Deliverable gets paid on a daily basis, and projections are high. As soon as the application launches, I will make sure each driver is compensated for each completed delivery. The driver gets 60% and the company gets 40%. For example, if the delivery is 20$. The driver gets 12$ and we get $8. As soon as the driver completes the delivery, the driver gets paid immediately through the mobile application. Per each state, there will be charging sales tax. There is a standard insurance clause the consumer agrees to when they register for the application. This is how our financial work = $2.99 a mile for a small to mid-size vehicle. $3.49 a mile for a larger car or SUV. Finally, it’s $3.99 to $4.49 depending on whether a truck, flatbed, or freight has to be used.",11-50,1.0,Seed,2020-06-02,1000.0,Seed,1000.0,1.0,11-50,Private,,,,,,0,3,2020,22521,False,False
