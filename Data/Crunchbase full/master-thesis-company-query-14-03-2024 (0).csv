The goal of our AI Squared technology is to level this playing field by providing AI integration technologies that would increase AI adoption and enable access to AI for anyone. This is our story. Dr. Benjamin Harvey was the Chief of Operations Data Science at NSA where he experienced challenges first-hand associated with the inability to adopt AI,  provide equitable access to AI, and unlock the value of AI for intelligence analysts and the military warfighter.  His inspiration came from his two brothers who were Army officers recently deployed to the Middle East (Kuwait, Iraq and Qatar) and SW Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan) who both relied on intelligence to achieve mission. He began a journey and developed a solution to solve these inequities that simplifies and accelerates AI integration into applications ultimately protecting lives of Americans and military warfighters in similar situations as his brothers.   Our vision is to build the world’s most powerful model integration framework and AI integration software which enables any application to become AI-powered. For the first time ever data scientists can describe their models using our model integration framework and our AI integration software will overlay intelligence from inference results directly into a pre-existing web application.

Flyp,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flyp-aaee,2019-06-05,day,"Secondhand Goods, Sharing Economy, Sustainability","San Francisco, California, United States",AI That Turns Used Goods Into Cash,"15,600",$1M to $10M,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://www.joinflyp.com,https://twitter.com/joinflyp,https://www.linkedin.com/company/joinflyp,"Flyp raised a $15 Million to put an end to the problem of landfill waste by using AI to resell it through millions of online sellers. But, why? Because the government won’t fix it, and big corporations won’t fix it, and $1 donations at checkout won’t fix it. So we chose to arm the people to fix it. We’re doing it by empowering millions of everyday people, stay at home moms, college students, and small entrepreneurs, to fix it. We are providing them with the technology and capital needed to save more than $200 Billion worth of used goods from being thrown into landfills every year and flipping this waste into profit. Turning it into cash, creating jobs, and flourishing an economy of people-owned sustainable businesses. The technology we’re building at Flyp: Flyp developed two core products aimed at empowering an army of stay at home resellers to effectively resell and monetize millions of items that would have ended up in landfill otherwise: 1) AI driven platform to monetize used clothes: Flyp developed the first and only platform that allows individual consumers and businesses to offload their pre owned items to online resellers who will sell it for them on marketplace like eBay, Poshmark, Facebook and others for a commission. Think of Thredup or TheRealReal, but instead of a centralized company doing the selling, it’s done by a network of thousands of small, stay-at-home online resellers. The key to this platform is Flyp’s AI-enabled matching technology which uses Pro Seller’s historical sales data to algorithmically match inventory with the Pro Seller who is the best fit to resell it. This unprecedented matchmaking has already succeeded in moving over 160 metric tons worth millions of dollars that would have ended in landfills, and is growing quickly at a 400% annual growth rate. 2) Automation platform to give small sellers the power of big retailers: In order to process millions of items successfully, Flyp had to invest in empowering the network of individual resellers by bringing to them the workflow automation capabilities that had only been available to big e-commerce players at exorbitant prices. This is why Flyp developed a fully free automation suite that saves resellers 90% of the time they used to put into inventory management and sales management across channels. This suite of tools has succeeded in becoming the new operating system for resellers, so much so that 85% of its users are daily active users making thousands of sales a day on auto-pilot. The impact of Flyp: Flyp’s impact is not a virtue signaling side effect, Flyp’s impact is fully visible and tangible in every transaction that occurs on the platform: 1) Environmental impact: With the fashion industry’s landfill waste contributing to more than 10% of global carbon emissions, being able to save millions of items from ending up in landfills and recirculating them in the market is Flyp’s core business model and impact lever at the same time. 2) Social and economic impact: While most are used to environmentally friendly alternatives being more costly than the polluting ones, Flyp has actually always held the belief that “sustainability can pay back in cash”. And on our mission to save the environment, we are creating and supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs for small stay-at-home entrepreneurs around the country, enabling them to generate millions of dollars in income and allowing them to sustain themselves and their families and creating a massive amount of new jobs in sustainability. We are also providing millions of shoppers with affordable items at a massive discount from retail, and allowing them to participate in the circular economy and reducing their own carbon footprint all while making very tangible economic savings. Flyp’s vision for the future and why it matters: At Flyp, we believe that one of the biggest hidden problems we face as a consumerist society is the immense waste generated from our purchases. This enormous waste is not only catastrophic to the environment, but it also represents a completely wasted economic value that is robbing consumers and businesses alike from recuperating sizable portions of the cost of the goods they had already paid for, simply due to a failure in logistics. The future we’re already creating at Flyp is one where all this massive waste, is turned into prosperous jobs for hundreds of thousands of small stay-at-home entrepreneurs, who in the process of reselling what would otherwise have gone to landfills, will create a massive circular economic cycle benefiting consumers, businesses and the environment.",https://www.facebook.com/joinflyp,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sustainability",2,"Dani Arnaout, James Kawas",11-50,4,Early Stage Venture,2022-05-03,10000000,USD,10000000,Series A,10000000,USD,10000000,Series A,14250000,USD,14250000,14250000,USD,14250000,"Gaingels, 2048 Ventures, 1517 Fund, Afore Capital, BAM Ventures",3,12,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-7.34%,33,1,,,0,0,,Advertising; business,,,

CISOs face an impossible risk landscape today.  80% of cybersecurity breaches start because of employee error.  The problem is exacerbating with generative AI, as a single hacker can specifically target thousands of employees in the same amount of time that they used to specifically target tens of employees with social engineering.  CISOs lack tools to deal with employee risk and are held accountable when a breach inevitably happens. By leveraging AI at each step, Dune Security empowers organizations to quantify individual risk through analyzing user behavior, context, learning patterns, and third party data. This allows the automation of tailored cybersecurity measures to each individual, transforming vulnerabilities into strengths. Dune is the central engine of all employee risk data, which is a solution that is not just timely for organizations but necessary in navigating the present cybersecurity landscape. This gives the CISO the capability to understand who are the high risk employees, to what extent, and why - as well as automatically remediate and restrict access to keep their organization safe. Today, Dune Security uniquely replaces legacy and ineffective security awareness training by pinpointing the crucial 8% of employees responsible for 80% of the risk, ensuring all employees receive personalized, machine learning-driven training tailored to their risk profile. CISOs also have easy access to quantifiable data via robust reporting and API-out capability, enabling them to both report to compliance auditors, regulators, and insurance underwriters, as well as restrict access to high-risk employees through other security systems.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"David DellaPelle, Michael Waite",1-10,1,Seed,2023-05-23,2000000,USD,2000000,Pre-Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,Pre-Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,2000000,USD,2000000,"Antler, Alumni Ventures, Firestreak Ventures, Sky Dayton",1,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,
