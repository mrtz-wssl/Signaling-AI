This network expansion has created virgin territories where there is little competition for prepaid wireless services. Progressive Wireless was formed to open 100 Cricket Wireless stores as quickly as possible. Cricket's dealer program provides excellent activation commissions, lifetime residuals and great margins on accessories.   There is a reason that 90-95% of franchises succeed. They are based on a long track record of success. There are currently over 3,300 Cricket stores in the U.S. and the parent company was started 15 years ago. As a Cricket dealer, we benefit from many franchise characteristics such as training programs, strong brand and corporate marketing assistance, increased purchasing power, operational support, location and construction assistance etc. Best of all Cricket does not charge a franchise fee.   The Company's President was recruited by Cricket Wireless after recently selling his exceptionally run 34-store Sprint dealership. He has an MBA and over 16 years of experience in the wireless industry. Between the officers and board members, the team has over 40 years combined experience in the wireless industry and over a century of business management experience.   The prepaid wireless market segment is large and growing. In the first quarter of 2013 new wireless customers chose prepaid plans 10 to 1 over contract plans. As of 2012 there were 100 million prepaid subscriptions in the U.S. Smartphone sales on prepaid networks doubled from 2012 to 2013 with nearly one third of all smart phones currently on prepaid plans.

We are building Datuum to enable data engineers and analysts to reduce manual work and burnout while helping organizations save up to 80% of the time and effort typically required for data projects. Using Datuum is far more efficient than manually figuring out all the data complexities, making Datuum a game-changer for optimization and cost reduction of the day-to-day data operations in organizations. Datuum AI engine simplifies data operations: - 3rd party data ingestion - Data extraction from a complex data source - Data migration from system A to system B - Accelerating new client onboarding - Mater Record creation - Data deduplication and consolidation Our recent integration successfully combined data from 12 different CRMs into a single database. This process would typically take 1-2 months per system if done manually. Our efficient approach allowed us to complete the task in a fraction of the usual time, significantly reducing the overall duration from 18-24 months to just one month.",https://www.facebook.com/datuumai,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Health Care, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",2,"Dmytro Zhuk, Leonid Nekhymchuk",1-10,2,Seed,2022-06-28,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,"SID Venture Partners, Sigma Software Labs",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,
