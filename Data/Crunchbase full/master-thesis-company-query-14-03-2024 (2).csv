Branded entertainment in movies & TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models. Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business.

Qube Money is a budget and banking based on the most successful behavior-changing budgeting method ever - cash envelopes. This unique banking experience maintains purpose and connection with the user's money plan or budget with each transaction.  This fundamentally changes the users' relationship with money resulting in greater savings and the consistent achievement of goals. The app modernizes the outdated envelope budgeting system of previous generations by digitizing budgets into “qubes”. Consumers then set limits for different qube budgets, like groceries, clothing, and entertainment.  A physical Qube Money debit card gives shoppers access to their pre-budgeted qube funds. This unique budgeting app helps consumers avoid overspending. When money in a qube is insufficient, shoppers are empowered to make in-the-moment budgeting choices about a purchase. The app is engineered to support a variety of budgeting dynamics in the household. Couples can choose Qube Companion Cards to strengthen financial transparency and keep open communication about shared budgets. Qube Money also offers an effective tool for families to track spending across different family members. With the help of Kid Cards, parents and children learn about responsible spending habits together.  FREEING people from the tyranny of money by breaking the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and eliminating personal debt is the heart of Qube Money. Qube Money is available to qualifying customers in the U.S. To learn more about the innovative app, visit the Qube Money website.

AI-powered menswear rental subscription service in the U.S.,"26,963",$1M to $10M,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://taelor.style/,https://twitter.com/TaelorStyle,https://www.linkedin.com/company/69612960,"Taelor is a Silicon Valley-based fashion industry start-up founded by Anya Cheng, ex Facebook and Target Lead who led teams to build Facebook Shopping and Target eCommerce and a current Northwestern University faculty member.  Taelor is a revolutionary new way for men to rent clothes, allowing them to look and feel great every day while also reducing their carbon footprint. The service uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence and personal stylists to select clothes for men based on their sizes and personal preferences. The clothes are shipped directly to customers, who can either wear them for two weeks and return them or purchase the clothes for up to 70% off the regular retail price. Customers then receive another box of clothes. “Our goal is to provide individuals with stylish, everyday menswear. We believe that every day is an opportunity to look good and feel confident,” said Cheng, a former digital product lead at Facebook, eBay and Target. “And when you rent clothes instead of buying them, you not only save the time and energy of having to search and shop for clothes, but you also help the environment, too, instead of purchasing clothes that will eventually end up in a landfill.” Cheng has a strong background in both the digital and retail space. A TEDx Talk speaker and best-selling book author, Cheng spent 15 years leading digital innovation teams at Facebook, eBay, Target, McDonald’s and Sears before launching Taelor. Cheng said she originally got the idea to start a clothing rental subscription service for men after becoming a huge fan of other clothing rental subscription services herself. “I became such a fan of renting clothes that I haven’t purchased any clothes for myself except for underwear for the past five years,” Cheng says. “But I realized that none of the clothing rental services really served menswear nor focuses on helping people to achieve career or personal goals in their everyday life, and I thought, men should be able to enjoy this service too so they can feel ready and confident for their day.”  The popularity of sustainability practices, minimalism, and no-ownership trends have caused the clothing rental business model to explode in recent years, with some analysts projecting that the Circular Fashion industry, which includes rental and resale, could earn as much as $66 billion by 2024 in the U.S. alone. Taelor gives customers the option to choose between two different subscription packages. The first option is a flat, monthly fee, where customers get two boxes per month, which include four shirts per box. The second option is for customers to pay a one-time fee, where customers receive three boxes in total, with four shirts per box. Both options include complimentary personalized styling, dry cleaning, and shipping both ways — making the process of renting and returning clothing easy and effortless. It’s a service that is a perfect solution for busy individuals who don’t want to spend time shopping or picking out their clothes. “I want to look good, but I don't really want to spend time shopping,” says Danny Ma, one of Taelor’s first customers. “I considered clothing subscription boxes for years, but I didn’t want to commit to buying something from each box. After using Taelor, I am much more confident!”  For more information about Taelor, please visit https://taelor.style.

What began as a vision to change the face of corporate leadership is now the largest community of senior women executives in the U.S. with representation from over 10,000 organizations and 77% of Fortune 100 companies. More than 40% of Chief members hold C-Suite positions.  Membership to Chief includes a wide range of services that help its senior women executive members raise their leadership game. These services span one-on-one or peer group executive coaching, programming centered on the most pressing and timely issues in business, and access to a vast, powerful community where members can build meaningful relationships — connections that unlock transformative professional outcomes.  Chief Membership: Executive Coaching: Chief offers coaching in small groups or one to one settings, depending on member preferences and needs. Small group coaching, or Core, is for members looking for peer advice on a variety of topics. Through Core, members meet regularly with 8-10 professional peers and an executive coach for candid conversations based on topics raised by each member of the group. The groups are carefully curated so that each member finds value in the professional peers they’re paired with. Executive Coaching is for members looking for goal-based, one-on-one guidance at their pace and on their schedule. This membership tier provides a more individualized approach to leadership advisory through one-to-one sessions with a vetted executive coach, all tailored to a member’s specific leadership needs.  Programming: Chief offers a wide range of in-person and virtual year-round programming all centered on the most timely and pressing issues facing business leaders. This includes roundtable discussions led by industry experts, inspiring speakers, local one-day conferences, and thought-provoking editorial content.  Community: In business, it’s widely known that who you know matters just as much as what you know. Through Chief, members have access to a vast community of business leaders through the digital platform or the many opportunities offered to connect in-person.  Chief has five elegant clubhouse locations in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, DC where members can meet new connections or book space for any of their professional needs.  For members who are not located in a clubhouse city, Chief has partnerships with organizations like Industrious and Soho House so that members can convene in-person. Chief’s digital platform allows members to seamlessly search for and connect with members relevant to them.  Chief has a grant program to reduce the financial barrier for executives who have historically faced identity-based inequity and those employed in the non-profit sector. Since launch, Chief has provided nearly $10 million in grants.
