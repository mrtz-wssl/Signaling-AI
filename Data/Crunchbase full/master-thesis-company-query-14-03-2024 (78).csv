We are a family owned and operated online pet and pet supply company.   As a young kid I LOVED to go to the local pet stores. For me they were always the ultimate fun spot. The puppies and kittens were always cool and fun to play with but my real interest came from the excitement and sense of wonder that came from the other animals. You know, the ones found in the darker rooms that were always pushed to the back of the stores.  These were the rooms that housed the lizards, snakes, fish, and other ""exotic"" small animals that always seemed so mysterious to me.  I was hooked before I even owned my first reptile. I can tell you a whole story about how after owning lots of different animals I realized that good quality products at decent prices are super hard to find, blah blah blah, but I won't.  We all know the reality is that good quality products are easy to find. The truth is that I have always wanted to own my own pet and pet supply store.  I LOVE working with animals, I LOVE working with people (as long as your nice, I don't really like the not nice people).  I love learning from and teaching others.  I have made lots of mistakes in my adventures of animal husbandry, and I know that I'll make more.  If I can help one other person avoid the same mistakes I've made and end up with a happy, healthy animal then I've accomplished my goal. With over 20 years experience keeping reptiles, amphibians, and fish we've learned a lot. One thing we absolutely know is that there is a lot we don't know. Our promise to you is that if we don't know the answer to a question we won't make it up. We will happily tell you we don't know, and then we will help you find the answer from credible and reliable sources. We're here for YOU.
