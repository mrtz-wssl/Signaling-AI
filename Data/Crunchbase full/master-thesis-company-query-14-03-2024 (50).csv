We connect patients to their doctors for real-time analysis to improve outcomes and improve the quality of life of patients. This company is inspired by my professional experience as a doctor with 12 years of clinical research experience and my personal experience with my father who was diagnosed with 3 different cancers -- colon, lung, and pancreatic cancer.  From these experiences, I identified a problem.   Doctors want patients to track and report any concerning daily symptoms.  Cancer patients are already stressed.   As a result, patient compliance is poor and inconsistent. The effect of all this is that: some side effects are not reported early become worse, costs go up, treatment takes longer, and patients end up have more stress.

Our chief antenna scientist, Dr. Mohamed S. Sanad, changed the world’s telecommunications trajectory at Nokia in 1994, leading the invention of the first internally embedded mobile phone antennas. Hoping to change the problematic direction of antenna technology growing in size and weight without delivering more efficient signals, Dr. Sanad dedicated the past 15 years to create what we now know as the IINNTENNA- a smaller, cost effective, and monumentally more efficient antenna evolution. With decades of experience, a passion for revolutionary antenna advancement, and his innate concern for humanity at large, Dr. Sanad’s work has tackled even more problems than he initially intended to solve. This technology’s broadband, far-reaching capabilities are vast. In base station applications it eliminates the need for multiple towers in any given area, positively impacting the global landscape, minimizing deforestation, and significantly reducing exposure to radiation from the daily use of our wireless devices. In satellites the IINNTENNA immensely decreases the size and weight of the structure while maximizing efficiency, cost, functionality, and much more. The IINNTENNA’s features can be used with almost any technology, including all LTE, WiFi, and Bluetooth devices, which could lead to a positive chain reaction that will take us into a more health-conscious and environmentally friendly future for all technological advancement. With the wide-scale integration of this technology, we will also experience global impact with increased upload/download speeds, reduced SAR and PIM values in active antenna technologies, and worldwide connectivity extending to aircraft and space technology.

All data is in compliance with the 2013 Drug Security Act. (requires full track/trace compliance for all drugs sold in USA by 2017).   The Problems 1) Counterfeit Drugs  - National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) found in 2010 that 97 percent of the more than 10,900 Internet pharmacies were selling counterfeit drugs. The World Health Organization reports counterfeit drugs cause 1Mil deaths/year in developing countries, India, Africa, and Asia. In the United States a rising occurrence of 100,000 deaths/year are caused by adverse drug reactions, drug mistakes and overdoses. Peter Pitts, president of The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and former FDA associate commissioner, estimates that in 2010, activities related to counterfeit drugs generated $75 billion, based on information obtained from government organizations. He expects it to grow by 20 percent annually in the coming years. If this estimate is correct, the counterfeit drug industry generates nearly as much cash as the world's fourth-largest wholesale drug company by revenue, AmerisourceBergen, which generated  $79 billion in 2012. 2) Non-compliance to drug therapy (USA) - The annual costs of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are estimated to be $174 billion and $403 billion, respectively, in the United States. As these chronic disease costs continue to rise, managed care stakeholders and health insurance companies are continually looking for areas in which the quality of care can be improved and expenditures reduced. One such area is medication compliance, where increased compliance rates have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes and reduced overall medical expenditures.Source JMPC Jul 2008 vol 8 •	up to 90% of diabetes patients do not take their medication well enough to benefit from that medication. •	33-50% of some cancer patients take less of their anti-cancer medicine than required. •	only 75% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients take sufficient medicine for it to be effective. •	Up to 75% of hypertensive patients do not adhere to their medicine. •	41-59% of mentally ill patients take their medication infrequently or not at all. •	33% of patients with schizophrenia don’t take their medicine at all, and 33% are poorly adherent. •	Less than 27% depressed patients adhere to their medication. The Solution TruMedicines has transformed drug tablets into data source points, which can be used for individual health improvement and collectively as a public health data source.
