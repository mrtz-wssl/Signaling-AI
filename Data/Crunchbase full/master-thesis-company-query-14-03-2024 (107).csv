We help athletes and teams monitor and meet their nutrition goals. NutriUnit is incorporating competition into nutrition thus tapping into the same drive that got athletes to the elite level of sports they are at. As young athletes move up in the world, many times they are faced with living on their own for the first time.  They are having to feed themselves for the first time, they have constantly changing class, practice and sleep schedules.  This is an extremely stressful time of change for many athletes.  NutriUnit is there to help bring regularity and accountability back into their lives and help them reach the goals they and their coaches have set for them. Almost every aspect of an athlete's training is down to a science; their lifting, their practices, cycling their intensity, as well as game preparation.  Competition is ingrained in all these areas. NutriUnit is extending that same competitive drive into your athletes' nutrition. By seeing their teammates progress throughout the day, they are constantly reminded of what they can do to stay competitive. The NutriUnit nutrition algorithm gives each athlete a custom nutrition goal which changes with their training intensity and whether they are in or out of season. NutriUnit was built by former collegiate athletes with one goal in mind, to make nutrition tracking accessible, affordable, and realistic for all levels of competitive sports.",,"Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Software,1,Cam Martin,1-10,1,,2021-09-22,,,,Non-equity Assistance,,,,,,,,,USD,,Launchpeer,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,

Kim Perkins is passionate about design and creating unique, aesthetically appealing and functional spaces. A Caribbean born and Navy veteran, Kim always had a heart for serving others. She uses her exceptional skills in project management to take on multiple design portfolios with a focus on helping her clients turn their ordinary house into a dream home.   Kim had her first encounter with interior design when she retained a designer for services on her Gainesville VA townhome. She wanted to create an oasis in her home after a long day of work and commuting. After learning that her $5k budget would not suffice that designer’s plan, Kim took matters into her own hands and designed her first space in 2014 for under $3k. After successfully completing that, Kim decided that she wanted to help others achieve this same success in making their house into the home they desire and within their budget. “Getting your dream home has more to do with how you feel when you are in your home. If you don’t immediately feel the weight of the world disappearing from your shoulders then it’s not a home, it’s a temporary landing space.”   Kim has been able to help several Virginia residents achieve their interior design goals with the budget that they’ve set. “Most people think that you need to be a millionaire to hire an interior designer, that’s not true. A good interior designer can help you achieve the vibe that you are aiming for but it does require you to be flexible. You can’t expect a Restoration Hardware look with a Target budget. However, we can accomplish the vibe of luxury, if that’s what you’re aiming for”, says Kim.  Kim is a certified interior decorator and understands different design styles and types. She listens to the clients needs, learns about what matters to them most, takes into account their future goals with the home and recommends the best approach for design.",,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Design, Events, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate",1,Kimberly Perkins,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,

Bandwhore is a music project that is genuinely unlike any other out there.   The debut of Bandwhore drops an insane 40+ albums with 200+ songs of over-the-top extreme metal  music.  Based in the styles of death, black, thrash, doom, prog, etc… METAL- with unique variations in alternate styles such as orchestral, electronic, acoustic, fusion, etc… while carrying a dark atmospheric feel throughout. The music itself is built around bizarre song structures, odd time signatures, frequent tempo changes,  and many progressive elements, and is  performed by some of the biggest names and talents in the world today.   Although this is currently still at a ""work-in-progress"" stage, the contributing musicians are over 70+ people in total. The line-up is simply incredible:  -DRUMMERS- Derek Roddy Kevin Talley Romain Goulon Matt Francis Erik Schultek Mark Cooper Kevin Paradis Marco Pitruzzella Juan Pablo Tom Pilasiewicz Gus Rios Josh Jetty Dani Sandvoss Hannes Grossman Shaun Black -BASS PLAYERS- Mike Poggione Dominic Forest Lapointe Terran Fernandez Paul Mcbride Anton Zhikharev Mike Bass Kevin Mccombs Diogo Almeida -SOLOS- Floyd Winters Richie Brown Tom Fountainhead Denis FD Jim Ross Tom Stevens John Tyler Joao Jacinto James Murphy Matt Roberts Paul Wardingham Youssef Helayel Marco Escalante Eric Hoffman Brian Hoffman Luke Jaeger Mark Hawkins Chase Moody Alex Zubair Tom Stevens Derek Roddy Keith Merrow Shane Williamson  Gene Palubicki Lee Cozens  Mahmud Gecekusu  Harry Lannon  Dan Gonzales Santiago Dobles  John Hartman  -VOCALS- Brian Fitzgerald Jesse Jolly Dima FD Erik Sayenga Steve Tucker Rogga Johansson Jim Greco Kamal El Khoueiry Danimal Garcia Ken England Tony Anderson Joe Lachapelle Scott Taylor Mike Shaw Coby Koch Martyn Moody Ben Davis Josh Crouse Damian Leski Shane Williamson Jason Freese Wayne Hades Clark Jo Dos' Theriomorphic Diogo Santana Jason Hohenstein Brian Smith  Mike Hrubovcak  Matt Degroot  Andrea Ciccio  James Brame Ed Webb Scott McMasters  Ines Hukic  Steve Giddens  Lou Quintana Shaun Black Lady Nemesis  The ARTWORK created by Mark Cooper (Markcooperart.com) is a modern masterpiece of truly epic proportion.   It’s a digital work about 10’ x 4’ big with a mind-boggling amount of detail and endless flow of intertwining ""madness"".  The 40+ albums of music all have album  artwork extracted from Mark’s full work, in which each individual cover on its own is created in immense detail and with a dark and twisted imagination.  While many will argue that “less-is-more” , in this case,  more is no doubt: much , MUCH more.  While there are many great artists out there, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anyone who has created a work quite like this one, as this art has been clocked to almost 3,000 hard focused hours!  (***3,000 hours is equal to about 125 full 24-hour days of actual work, or over a year of actual 8 hour a day work).   People talk about extreme music all the time, but you don’t really hear about extreme art.  There are extreme subjects, and “meaning” in artwork perhaps,  but this creation from the mind of Mark Cooper is truly “extreme-art”.   Bandwhore is a project created & arranged by guitarist Jim Ross as a DIY venture under the guise of ""Starved Artist Records"". While current trends of artists and musicians seem to release a handful of albums over a lifetime, Bandwhore releases a lifetime of music ALL AT ONCE!  This debut truly is like nothing else out there. The sheer volume and mass of this music, artwork, and the people involved, make this massive project ""BANDWHORE"" an unprecedented form of musical works for the 21st Century. ***more info at www.bandwhoremetal.com",https://www.facebook.com/Bandwhor,"East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",1,Jim Ross,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,
