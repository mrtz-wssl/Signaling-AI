In other words, having a primary bank is not necessary, thereby eliminating monthly rent charges, overdraft fees, payday loan and check cashing company abuse, and various other fee generating schemes. Utilizing a combination of various Asian ""cashless"" banking systems, like India's UPI, Dapple Pay was created to start a revolution that says, ""People do not need to pay a bank to conduct day to day business."" Dapple Pay is a small Startup created by 2 South Florida Civil Rights Attorneys who wanted to create a way to reduce the Florida's high and often undisclosed Child Support ""tax"" levied on child support payments. As their brainstorming expanded, these former financial services professionals reexamined the available mobile wallets and payment systems and realized that the over 25% of unbanked and underbanked americans, mostly Minorities and Immigrants, needed relief too. Dapple Pay Wallet was born. Upon launch, Dapple Pay will be available in iOS and Android devices. Dapple Pay can be used internationally, and where contactless (NFC) payment consoles are used. Additionally, Dapple Pay will be available in Ecuador, El Salvador, and all other locations where US Dollars are used as primary currency (except for Zimbabwe and all other OFAC banned countries.) Dapple Pay is PCI-DSS Compliant and soon will enable in-App Cannabis Sales transactions. Dapple Pay's Developers are UPI (system used in India) experts.

Funding feature films is a trillion-dollar business with 5 to 10x returns in the first year after the content's release. As the explosive small-screen affection causes audiences to shift from theaters to online movie viewing, film producers lose a revenue flow and thus search for a better online distribution deal. There is a vast market opportunity to synch the marketplace via a dedicated API platform, letting film studios shift from the old passive spectator archetype to a new interactive audience model. FilmoCrat addresses critical issues within the sector. Audience engagement, investor-focused transparency, and filmed-content payoffs in real-time are among them.
