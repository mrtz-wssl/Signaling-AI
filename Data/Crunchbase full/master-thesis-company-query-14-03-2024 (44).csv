Someone once said that an idea can change the world, and while at first it is hard to imagine the magnitude of what each person can achieve with their actions, one must always take the first step to make them a reality. At ezFrontiers we want to change the world, but the world of the entrepreneurs, and let them through their ideas make this world a better place for all of us. That is why we want everyone to know that to become an entrepreneur you don't need great things, just a great idea. We know that starting a business is possible for everyone who has the initiative, wherever they live, and that is what we seek to communicate. But not only that, which we do by training entrepreneurs through the content we publish on our various digital platforms, but we also seek to put it into practice. It's very easy to say that everything is simple, but to say it with foundation is something else very different. Thus, through the creation of companies in the United States, we seek to help entrepreneurs from all over the world, especially Spanish-speaking ones, to effectively carry out their projects, supporting them with the required procedures. For many it is complex, and we do not want bureaucratic obstacles to ruin an idea that, perhaps, can change the world. It's a first step, the rest is up to them, but we want to be there to do our bit. It is said that when undertaking the most important thing is to start, and we are very clear about that, because when we started this project, ezFrontiers, we also went through that stage. Creating a company for many sounds like something that is only reserved for executives with a tie or people with a lot of money who are in an office at the top of a building full of glass panels that make it look elegant, but no. On a day-to-day basis, SMEs are the drivers of every country's economy, they are the engine that generates jobs and changes the lives of millions of people. That is why we are motivated to liberalize the creation of companies, to make every entrepreneur see that there are no obstacles to start a business. That it does not matter their nationality, profession or way of thinking, because anyone, as long as they are over 18, can create a company to bring their ideas to life. And not only that, but working for them, because that is another issue that motivates us, working for oneself.",https://facebook.com/ezfrontiers,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Professional Services,1,Gonzalo Parragué,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22.18%,35,,,,,,,,,,

We love the thrill of searching for that grail watch. Or finding hidden gems in the used market… But, let’s just face it. This hobby of ours can be a bit expensive. If it wasn’t because we could buy and sell watches, it wouldn’t be very fun to collect would it? However, we were getting increasingly frustrated with the options we had when buying and selling watches: — On the one hand, we could buy or sell watches on watch forums without being charged commission or fees. But with the number of fake watches being sold on those forums, and the fact that it can be really difficult to be sure who you’re actually dealing with, it also involves a high risk. Especially when it comes to investment pieces. — On the other hand, we could go to the major online marketplaces and watch sites, and base our buying decisions on reviews and ratings. But in that case, the site often charges a hefty fee or commission, making the price of watches unnecessarily expensive. — We couldn’t pursue this lifestyle of buying and selling watches, because the commissions would eat up our budget. The more watches we traded, the more expensive it would be. — And whats the fun in that? Many online marketplaces charge sellers unevenly… The way the fees and commissions are charged by many online marketplaces, hits private collectors, who just want to sell a single watch, much harder than large retailers, selling hundreds or thousands of watches. That might be great for business, but not really fair to the watch enthusiasts wanting to sell a watch to finance another purchase. We founded ValueYourWatch.com to offer a platform with high transparency, where watch enthusiasts can purchase watches with peace of mind. You won’t be charged any commissions! We wanted to create a marketplace where watch collectors could at least break even when buying and selling watches. So there’s no commissions pushing up the prices on any of the watches, only a low monthly subscription fee for sellers wanting to list several watches for sale. We wanted it to be fair for all sellers, so if you just want to list a single watch you will get your membership for FREE, and not be charged any fees.* — We believe that will benefit the retailers selling through Value Your Watch too, because we help watch lovers — their customers — get more funds for their next watch purchase. * In case you choose a payment processing party, like PayPal or Stripe, as your payment method,they might charge you a processing fee. But Value Your Watch will NOT be charging you anything. One Big Family of Enthusiastic Watch Lovers Our goal is to establish a community for selling and buying timepieces. So we encourage our sellers to link their Value Your Watch profile to their social media channels and show who they are. That way buyers can see who they are buying their new timepiece from, and it won’t just be an anonymous transaction. Our conditions are simple: Register your profile Select your plan (from $0 / month) Start selling!* * Unlike many other marketplaces you are allowed to sell listed watches outside of the platform. Value Your Watch is simply here to make it easier for watch lovers to buy and sell watches with more transparency.",https://www.facebook.com/valueyourwatch/,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle",1,Honza Hroch,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.43%,8,,,,,,,,,,

Employer-sponsored healthcare accounts for half of US healthcare costs and is usually an employer's largest expense aside from wages. Rising costs have prompted employers to restructure their benefits with higher employee premiums and larger deductibles. Employer-sponsored coverage costs 224% more than Medicare for the same services from the same providers. This dynamic is the result of various intermediaries who stand between the employer and their employees on one hand and high-value care providers on the other. Employers have reached a tipping point. They have reached the limit on the financial responsibility they can offload to their employees. New organizations built to take risks by delivering high-value care are looking to contract directly with employers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) raises the fiduciary duties of employers to spend healthcare dollars effectively. SubPop is the first group purchasing organization for employers for healthcare services. SubPop leverages market-level purchasing power to give employers agency, improve their ability to purchase high-value healthcare benefits at reasonable prices, and increase transparency in the healthcare industry - all while providing providers direct access to purchasers who have traditionally had to wade through expensive and inefficient channels. Employers can use our tools to identify opportunities in their claims history and then find and evaluate high-value providers. SubPop aggregates purchasing power to get the best contracts. SubPop measures provider performance against contractual obligations to improve provider selection. SubPop is the only complete aggregation and specification solution for employers. We have a partnership with the Purchaser Business Group on Health (PBGH), a purchasing collaborative representing nearly 40 private employers and public entities that spend $350 billion annually on healthcare for over 21 million Americans. Chris Gormley, the CEO, and co-founder of SubPop, has successfully built and led healthcare technology platforms and purchasing organizations. He has previously worked at FreeMarkets (acquired by Ariba), GE Healthcare, Medpricer (acquired by Premier), and Premier.",,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Administrative Services, Commerce and Shopping, Health Care, Internet Services, Transportation",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,
