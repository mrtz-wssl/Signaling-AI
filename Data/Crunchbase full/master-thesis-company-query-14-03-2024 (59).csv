For example, if you want to build a water deck and you're only interested in ""water type"" cards, we will open every single pack in the box/case and you get to keep ALL of the ""water"" type cards from the 36 packs per box! Instead of getting stuck paying for a lot of cards you don't really want or need.

Compounding these external challenges are their relevant internal challenges - a lack of time and resources created by an incessant work environment, to properly market and advertise their business. They rely on word-of-mouth and limited promotional methods that cannot and do not provide equitable data necessary to determine if these routines are proving valuable.

SteadyTake,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/steadytake,2019-07-01,month,Human Computer Interaction,"Seattle, Washington, United States",National Video Production,"823,424",,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,https://steadytakepro.com,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandreaday/,"What does it cost to produce a video? If you have spent any time attempting to get a quote for a video you want produced, I'm sure you've discovered that prices are all over the place from $99 to $50,000. With that kind of price range it's helpful to know why? This article is written to provide some transparency in how video production is priced. Pricing for video can be compared to automobiles like Lexus and Toyota. Lexus is built by Toyota but features are added to a Toyota beyond the ""requirements"" to produce the luxury brand Lexus. To open this conversation its important to understand that technology has reduced the effort and thereby cost of production through digital recording vs. linear tape, user-friendly digital suites for editing and bandwidth that supports cloud distribution. Lighter, cheaper and innovated advancement in equipment allows any talented producer to create content for a fraction of the cost previously. So, why are the prices still so high? For reasons not really understood, the industry has taken a long time to shift its dependence on high price tags even though the demand for high-priced video has dropped like a stone. But one factor is the cost of overhead. A studio full of equipment requiring insurance and repairs with employees is a nut that has to be covered by a handful of jobs per month. This is because the industry is a gig-based economy with jobs coming along sporatically. As a result, a local studio or videographer must charge a high price to stay in business. Lower prices have also emerged due to competition for gigs posted to online marketplaces like Upwork, Freelancer, etc. So, based on the above, what does it really cost to produce a video? The breakdown is as follows. A plan and treatment are required before starting any filming. So, if you need a script written or a storyboard built, either you will need to do it (to save money) or pay a professional to help you. So, several hours of a creative director will be required to get you started. Then once the plan is set, the creative assets are created from voice recording to capture of footage, per the plan. Finally, editing. This sounds simplistic but it really is not. All in all, it's about time spent during each process, how many people performing it, and the cost of that resource. Bottom line, the cost of time is based upon the skill required with the videographer in the field being the most costly at about $100 an hour with his/her equipment (per camera). An Editor is 1/2 that as well as a creative director. Then there are more tasks, who is directing? Who is responsible for lighting and sound? If your videographer is also a DP (Director of Photography) he/she can direct your production and manage sound and lighting with an assistant called a PA (production assistant). So, how long does it take to do each task? It depends entirely upon what the end result will be. A simple 1-minute, 1 camera, 1 location video would generally cost $600-$750 finished. A 2-minute, 3 camera, 4 location video would cost $4,000 - $6,000. So, when you are trying to figure out how much your video is going to cost, a simple rule of thumb is keep it simple or plan for a higher budget so you never sacrifice quality which is the most important feature of all. So, pricing above this is profit or goes to the creative team that is designing your video strategy and your videos. The $99 video is a DIY (do-it-yourself) video using an online ad-creator.

Almost every company is gathering a lot of data and is looking for professionals who can analyze that data in order to make predictions & generate insights. Companies like Tencent are employing several thousands of data scientists who are using data and building machine learning models in order to generate predictions & make smarter decisions. Unfortunately, the demand for data scientist exceeds the supply. According to McKinsey research, there will be a shortage of 1.25 million data scientists by 2024. Quality data scientists are hard to find and expensive to employ as a single quality data scientist costs about $117,000 per year according to Glassdoor research. The data scientist has to then spend 45% of their time on model building that we believe is a very repetitive & time consuming process. On top of that, organizations that are thinking about building an in-house solution require more than 3.5 million RMB in investment & usually more than 6 months of development.  That is why we’re building mltrons, which is predictive analytics in 5 clicks. We’re are enabling organizations to build and leverage advanced machine learning & deep learning algorithms without ever writing a single line of code or worrying about investing in infrastructure. The users just need to prepare the data and upload it into the application after which they need to tell the system what they want to predict. Then automatically, our AI engine builds the best fit model for their problems and provides them with real-time predictions and insights.  Our AI engine is built on a robust architecture with state of the art algorithms. Our goal is to get companies from raw data to actionable predictions in the fastest way possible. Mltrons Ai engine can be connected to various data sources after which it loads the data, prepares and cleans the data, build hundreds of thousands of combinations of algorithms and then selects the best model for the problem that can be easily deployed in one click, either by using REST API, uploading new data or using our visual prediction.

Gleenr is a sophisticated emotional mapping software that can give you insight about a particular person or situation by gleening non-verbal cues from a video. When you upload a video to Gleenr we measure the facial micro-movements and physical attributes that are displayed. These measurements give us clues, as to how the person was feeling about what they're saying. The results of our measurements, “the gleen,” can give you some additional insight so you can move forward in this situation with a little more knowledge. We’re not the only resource for you to validate if someone's being sincere but we can give you a little help. This is especially important in situations where you're not meeting in person and can’t get a good gut reaction for yourself. It can also be helpful if you’re feeling as if something just isn’t quite right but can’t quite put your finger on it. The added information Gleenr can provide can give just enough distance and objectivity to move forward in a way that is safe and beneficial for you. WHAT WE MEASURE & WHAT IT TELLS US Gleenr software tracks eye movements and facial muscles using scanning technology tracking 4 layers deep. The scanned information is applied to an algorithm to determine overall sincerity, with moment-to-moment measurements of satisfaction, anger, disgust, stress, excitement, and even neutral ambivalent emotions. Gleenr also tracks physical attributes and changes in heartbeat, breathing, and blood pressure. These physiological factors have long been associated with emotional responses and can be a good indicator if something is simmering beneath the surface. Having a roadmap of these responses can give you a heads up if things may be not what they seem. WHAT WE DON'T DO... Gleenr isn’t facial recognition software and we don’t retain any biometric data that can be used to identify people. We can’t tell you who the people are in a video, we can only interpret how they may be feeling based on non-verbal cues. We also don’t share your video gleens with any third parties. The videos uploaded and analyzed are done so privately and confidentially. This information is for you, we are committed to your privacy and value discretion in any situation.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Software",2,"James Burrell II, Kanat Sultanbekov",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,

Our eco-system enables this at the bare minimum costs so the founders can fully focus on delivering the product vision.  Challenges faced by Tech Founders Working in isolation can be a big issue when you’re shaping considerable start-up thoughts into fully developed ideas. Tech founders need people to brainstorm, support and build a roadmap. They require a team consisting of a Product Manager, UI/UX Designers, Architects and Engineers to fully develop an idea. While the technology team behind the bootstrapping of the product is important for MVP success, attracting top talent seems impossible due to money and identity constraints. As a part-time tech co-founder, you can’t take a huge risk by building an in-house team at an early stage. Early-stage startups are mostly self-funded with small capital for MVP development which often compromises the product scope or the quality and stability of the product. The result is a product-fit failure. How do we support Tech-startup founders? We share the founders' vision and start-up risk to successfully bootstrap or launch the MVP and get them investment-ready. We engage through milestone-based equity in the start-up to mitigate both financial and product risks, unlike traditional agencies that are only concerned about billing hours. We engage with start-up founders in three phases. The first stage focuses on prototype development, while the objective of the second stage is to build the product, and the third stage is geared towards self-sustainability. Our goal is to take founders through the first stage to launch your MVP and establish a product-market fit. That means you have a stable and scalable minimum viable product to test with your prospective users and prove the traction to raise the next round of funding. After the MVP launch, we will support you to establish your in-house tech function.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,
