One century later, in 1956 Malcolm McLean invented containerization, enabling not just modern steamships but also global retail powerhouses like Walmart. Today, we have entered the third wave of value creation. Instead of railroads and steamships, the new-economy supply chain leaders have learned how to harness the power of technology.
