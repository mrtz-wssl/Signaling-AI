Critical decisions cannot wait for manual analysis to create contextual meaning from insights, they need to be automated to deliver decision guidance and Augmented Outcomes for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. Decision Point AI™ is the company that has an Augmented Intelligence Platform that facilitates Decisive Impact for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. It utilises Decision Science instead of Data Science to focus corporate efforts on critical and Augmented Outcomes to deliver Decisive Impact to its clients. Decision Point AI™ is vertical and horizontal Market agnostic and is focused on technology and consultancy services for any industry or organisation. Our Augmented Intelligence Platform is already in use in Government decision making and Decision Point is currently engaging with a number of commercial clients on their specific business cases. Decision Science Data driven decision making augmented intelligence #dddm_ai ""Decision Point AI™ augmented intelligence supports decision making when there is a lack of data to otherwise make decisions"" While the standard pathway for Decision Science is to focus on data as a tool to make decisions and solve business problems. Decision Point has further augmented the current thinking by adding collated data through an augmented intelligence platform and applying human interpretive algorithms that enable expert context to establish both true meaning and trajectory in a real time manner. Real time DDDM through Decision Point AI™ dddm_ai establishes a clear competitive advantage in a world where enterprises are told competitive advantage no longer exists DDDM_AI is fundamentally different from the slower data science route which is involved in finding insights by analysis and modelling from data, after this data has been collected, processed and structured by data engineer. While business who are ""driven most by data-based decision making had 4% higher productivity rates and 5-6% higher profits, a study of 179 large publicly traded firms"" by Brynjolfsson, Hitt and Kim of MIT Center for Digital Business found in 2011 based on Data Science. No impact analysis currently exist for the evolutionary real time DDDM_AI that utilises augmented intelligence but by extrapolation the expectation is for higher productivity, utilisation and profits for client companies. Subjective Logic Augmented Intelligence A fundamental aspect of the human condition is that nobody can ever determine with absolute certainty whether a proposition about the world is true or false. The human capacity to create theories or hunches can have profound impact on the direction and effectiveness of organisations, enterprise and countries. Decision Point utilises an Augmented Intelligence Platform built on subjective logic to refine and explicitly emphasise the factors and certainties that underwrite decision options. Additionally the Decision Point Augmented Intelligence Platform utilises human insights as part of its data queries to augment the processing power of the AI with context and meaning of that data through human knowledge and expertise. Subjective logic is a type of probabilistic logic that combines the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Subjective logic explicitly takes uncertainty and source data trust into account. Subjective logic is suitable for modelling and analysing situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources. Subjective logic can be used for modelling and analysing trust networks where a measurement of the degree to which one social actor (an individual or a group) trusts another social actor and Bayesian networks that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",https://www.facebook.com/dddmai/,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Health Care, Information Technology, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Karl A L Smith,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,

We use AI to enhance fitness instructors, not to replace them, because we believe it's time to put community back into community-based fitness. With 9 out of 10 Americans planning to continue to work-out from home traditional fitness is getting left behind with pen & pencil or low-tech band-aids while AI fitness is removing the human element altogether. But humans crave social connections with other humans - in fact, it's the greatest predictor of longevity. Our user interviews confirm the importance of community with 53% of people who exercise and 91% of trainers reporting that they enjoy the aspect of community and interaction with others.  Our easily accessible, mobile solution does not require any hardware and allows fitness instructors to provide real-time, motivating feedback during remote, or hybrid, interactive classes, without having to stop demonstrating proper form and technique while saving countless hours on data analysis through AI generated insights and customized, actionable wellness plans.

This capability is enabled through a phenomenon known as binaural beats, which occurs within the brain when two separate frequencies are played into each ear. The brain receives these sounds and perceives a third tone – the difference between the two frequencies. The difference in frequencies played in each ear correlates to the desired brainwave of the user. These effects are welcoming, not overwhelming, and typically take around fifteen minutes to be felt by most users. For example, the Neuraform plays at 510hz within the left ear, and 516hz within the right ear. The difference in frequencies is 6hz, whose correlating brainwave is associated with REM sleep, thus this particular session would aid users in neurologically slipping into a sleepy state of consciousness and would engage the brainwaves responsible for REM sleep. Neuraform’s relaxation and sleep sessions deliver a frequency within the Delta and Theta brainwave spectrum between 2hz-8hz. By targeting specific frequencies known to induce certain mental states, Neuraform is able to help users fall asleep quicker, induce REM sleep, enhance lucid dream states, meditate, or even just simply de-stress. Neuraform’s concentration sessions enable enhanced concentration and focus – and are a perfect pairing with study or work. These sessions increase and enhance brainwaves within the alpha range – the dominant brainwave during study and work. Create your own sessions with the session studio, and add some background noise with Neuraform's curated library of background tracks. Perfect the mix with Neuraform's mixer palette, and share your session with friends and the wider Neuraform community.",https://www.facebook.com/neuraform-104684032146709/,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Biotechnology, Health Care, Mobile, Platforms, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Justin Means,1-10,1,Seed,2019-01-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,
