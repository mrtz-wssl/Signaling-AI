According to research, the global market for UTM services is estimated to be worth 517 million USD between 2018 and 2022. As the drone industry continues to boom, the number of drones in the air is expected to increase exponentially over the coming years. Left unchecked, these drones present a serious threat to manned aviation so safe integration of drone traffic with existing manned air traffic is an absolute necessity. Unifly’s award-winning UTM platform is available on the market today as a mature software product that can be configured to suit the stakeholders’ needs. It connects official entities with operators to integrate drones into the airspace safely and securely. The Unifly platform allows drone pilots to check the legal status of their flight and allows authorities to monitor and manage drone traffic in their airspace. Unifly’s (UTM) platform is already in use today by the national authorities of Germany, Denmark, Austria and Belgium. Recognizing the value of collaboration, Unifly is an active participant in several leading European drone projects. Unifly is a global company. It is active in the US (LAANC certified). Unifly also deployed the first UTM system in Africa to support UNICEF’s drone corridor in Malawi. In Asia, the company provides the technical UTM backbone to ensure safe drone flights at the Fukushima Robot Test Field centre. Unifly as a company was founded in 2015 by a number of aerospace experts. Already in 2012, a team of air traffic controllers, pilots and engineers shared a vision of developing a system that would allow them to manage and track the growing number of drones flying in the air and to easily contact the drone operator if needed.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither the host nor the shows guests shall be glorified, however, the guests may be recognized publicly for their efforts. The host agrees to act only as a sub-host next to Jesus Christ the only star of the show. The host typically interviews people of interest as well as Christian celebrities that bring glory to Jesus Christ and not themselves. The host may also bring in experts who are gifted by the Holy Spirit in order to educate the viewers on different topics. Therefore, the television host may act as a God glorifier, encourager, comforter, interviewer, educator, mediator, or all six. TV Producer A Christian television producer is responsible to make sure the guests being interviewed have a godliness that either surpasses or equals their gifting, while never choosing gifting over godliness. A producer coordinates and supervises all aspects of a production, from the creative to the administrative. TV producers also make the financial decisions and handle contracts, talent and bargaining agreements, and other administrative details. While producers get to be in on the fun of planning and executing a production, they also deal with troubles during production and keep everything within budget.",,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Rev Thomas Luke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,

The last thing you want to do is rummage through your closet, turning your bedroom upside down in an attempt to find the perfect outfit.   Before founding Style Baby OMG Boutique, Jazmine Rodriguez was a busy, on-the-go woman who loved fashion but never had time to create truly exceptional outfits. She recognized the need for fuss-free clothing that consumers could trust.   In the pursuit of her dreams, she launched an online fashion store with only $500, but what she lacked for in finances, she made up for in passion. Eventually, she graduated from her bedroom and acquired an office, granting her the physical and mental space to take Style Baby OMG Boutique to the next level. Today, her top priority is taking your style to new heights, as well.  Our collection of trendy, high-quality pieces are designed with you in mind. Here, you’ll find an outfit for any occasion, whether you’re going on a night out or out to brunch with your girlfriends, allowing you to finally say goodbye to the frustrating “I have nothing to wear” days.
