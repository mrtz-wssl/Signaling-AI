This bold objective led to the creation of the Valilly Talent Intelligence platform, derived from an ingenious coupling of talent management solutions with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Thanks to the major investment in time spent by Valilly software engineers in the development of this proprietary software system, human resource professionals and hiring decision makers now have the ability to quickly find that needle in the haystack hire that they desperately crave. As a result of these efforts, the most noteworthy result that we wish to bring to your attention is the cost savings that utilizing Valilly, rather than traditional recruiters, can provide. But that’s not all that Valilly’s evolutionary Talent Intelligence platform provides and plans to become. With the ambition of a gallant conqueror that has been amassing a force that is second-to-none, Valilly intends to become the dominant force in the HR Tech industry, forever changing the way companies source, recruit, hire, manage, and transition talent. Continuously looking to steamroll through the human resource barriers faced by hiring managers each day, Valilly has the means and drive to push the boundaries of Talent Intelligence innovation to heretofore unrealized new heights.  For all those companies that have been expending large resources to find the talent that they need, to then dishearteningly come away with unsatisfactory returns, Valilly’s Talent Intelligence is the safety net to their needlessly depreciating values.

Timeless,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/timeless,2019-04-01,day,,"Palo Alto, California, United States",Timeless is a calendar as a service marketplace — to match people's time and services.,"436,482",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://timeless.space,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/timeless-economy,"The order of time is predictably linear, yet the order of life events unpredictably occurs with entwined complexity. While conventional calendars provide time management features, they do little to realize the value of time. Our vision is to organize time & make it meaningful. By fusing calendar events with real-world semantic knowledge, we can develop a web-scale graph that collates all the facts about people, places, and events. We call this the Time Graph. This computational breakthrough of organizing the web as things, not strings, was first achieved with the introduction of the Google Knowledge Graph. By applying similar ML techniques, we can explore the world as made up of things, and we can experience the world as made up of events — of happenings. In our everyday happenings, we carry on tasks — forging relationships, indulging curiosities, pursuing purpose and happiness — all within a ticking clock. It's why, as time charges forward, it can feel like we have limited control over the use of our time. We give too much time to tasks that should take less time, and not enough on activities that give our hearts joy. Why does a Monday DMV visit feel it drags on forever, and a Sunday brunch spent with closest friends too short? Because the conventional calendar treats the physical flow of time as constant, its value unchanging and independent of any external context. It is why we are developing Timeless calendar to enrich each event with its own meaning and value relative to the vantage of the observer. Or philosophically, time is indexical, as the value of time can be measured only in relation to the context in which it occurs. Our philosophical rumination on the meaning of time is a reflection of our own challenges of organizing time. Intuitively we feel our experience of time and events is complex and filled with personal idiosyncrasies. In our lifetime, we make millions of time-event decisions from small to big: when to wake up, when to eat, when to meet with friends and families, when to exercise, how much to sleep, when to take a vacation. While we can work harder to earn more money, it is impossible to earn more time. So we use time-saving services or get help when we lack the necessary qualifications to perform specific tasks. The Internet provides improvements in the retailing of goods through increased speed, convenience, and large inventory. Amazon made it possible to instantly fulfill millions of orders with a click of a button. We believe we can achieve the same economic value for millions of service providers and billions of service customers. The calendar is the de-facto time management tools to match people’s time & services. Our business plan is to build a calendar as a service marketplace to help us save time — by getting helpful services with a tap of a button.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Zi Wang,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,0,4,,Education; entertainment,,,

As early as 2008, the UK was considering a ban on patio heaters, with an estimated economic impact in the UK alone of up to 250M euros in lost revenue per year to the pubs, restaurants, and caterers that depend on them. Armita-X is disrupting the entire outdoor space heating industry by making use of our most current understanding of thermodynamics and modern computing to more efficiently generate heat- saving gas, money, and the environment. Our patented technology will be the first to bridge the gap between outdated mechanical devices and modern, intelligent, energy-conscience devices. Armita-X is a marvel in thermodynamic efficiency: Capturing waste in the form excess heat, the unit is able to generate its own electricity. Equipped with wireless networking, even multiple units are easy to control from the palm of your hand. Both the smartphone application and the touchscreen panel on the device provide information regarding the level of propane gas remaining, the duration until the propane gas cylinders need to be exchanged, battery levels, and temperature control options. In addition, the unit is smart enough to automatically power down when a leakage is detected. Ultimately, we envision Armita-X as a modular platform rather than a simple device. Based on needs addressed by customer discovery, we’ve already added the option to add lights, a touchscreen, and speakers, amongst others. Each Armita-X can be customized to match the particular needs of the end-user. A sleek aluminum casing encloses heating elements that better utilize propane gas, generating longer heating periods per unit of gas, and making use of the entire tank. Efficient design incorporates three different heat sources: while the first element helps generate heat quickly, the third element helps retain heat, striking a balance that allows for fast start-up and longer sustained heating periods.  Using proximity sensors, Armita-X knows when to turn on and off, minimizing waste. Pressure sensors remove the guess-work of how much gas is left in the tanks, meaning you’ll no longer effectively throw your money away when disposing of tanks that still have leftover gas. our target market are residential( backyards) and commercial (restaurants,hotels, cafe's, bar's ,outdoor events and parties and etc).",https://www.facebook.com/Armita-X-178962392726604/,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Energy, Food and Beverage, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Sports, Sustainability, Travel and Tourism",1,Mehdi Doorandish,1-10,1,,2019-01-01,,,,Non-equity Assistance,,,,,,,,,USD,,Cleantech Open,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

In doing so, the company aims to create a public benefit by providing a secure and seamless process while helping to reduce the burden on government officials who will no longer have to deal with incomplete applications leading to additional work which ultimately cost taxpayers. Founder and CEO Adam Boalt is a serial entrepreneur who previously founded RushMyPassport.com and LiveAnswer.com in the past 5 years. He sold LiveAnswer.com to the publicly-traded S&P 500 and Fortune 1000 company, Stericycle. Boalt participated in Washington, D.C.’s Open Data Initiative to promote transparency in government and was awarded first place in an Innovation Contest by former President Barack Obama's CIO, Vivek Kundra. Shortly thereafter, Boalt was invited to speak at the World Bank's Open Data Summit. NOTE: govWorks was launched in January 2018 and is not related to the govWorks founded in 1999. The main difference between the two companies is that that the new govWorks is starting at the Federal government and with foreign governments.
