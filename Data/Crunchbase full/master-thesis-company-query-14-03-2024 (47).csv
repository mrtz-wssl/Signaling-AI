In just a few years, he completed over $1 billion in condominium conversions and was a partner in one of the top three condominium conversion companies in the US. Mr. Roberts then focused on assembling prime commercial properties in Miami and co-founded Miami Worldcenter, the second largest mixed-use development planned in the US. Today, the Roberts' family portfolio includes a 13+ acre assemblage adjacent to Miami Worldcenter and Mr. Roberts is the co-founder and owner of Club E11EVEN and the land on which it sits.
