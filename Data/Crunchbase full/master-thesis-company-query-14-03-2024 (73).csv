Our Meritocracy Club is creating the Human-based SINGULARITY. We are a tech Startup that works like a global social club specializing in the sale or exchange of consulting hours of members as e-commerce. Socialmeet is the first meritocratic marketplace, with a focus on empowering the best CEOs, founders, independent consultants, celebrities, intellectuals, professionals, and skilled workers to build strong reputations as experts in their fields while they enhance their social lives. Our website, https://meritocracy.club/, works like Netflix, but instead of watching a show or movie, customers pay for monthly subscriptions to meet and talk with meritorious members one-on-one for business or educational purposes such as guidance on theses or academic papers, receiving expert advice, language instruction, making friends, and why not dating? The best part of the platform is that coordination of appointments does not need to be a nightmare anymore. Because every week our members input their available hours, customers may easily schedule paid-only consulting hours with them. Alternatively, fortunate customers may be able to get a free half hour with our experts. Socialmeet is Co-creator of MERITOCRACY PLUGIN. This innovative new plugin: ""Meritocracy"" that lets you connect WEB2 (WordPress, 43% of the Internet) with WEB3 (NEAR Protocol). Meritocracy integrates with myCred to enable cryptocurrency-powered rewards and gamification. We won a grant from NEAR FOUNDATION and built the plugin using NEAR PROTOCOL technology. We are truly grateful that one of the most important protocols in Web3 trusts us. We developed the MERITOCRACY PLUGIN in partnership with myCred (one of the top five gamification plugins for WordPress) by WPExperts, and Socialmeet, The Best Meritocracy Club in the World, according to Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Safari, Yahoo, and others. The importance of this plugin is that any WordPress website owner (which constitutes 43% of the internet, around 810 million websites use WordPress in 2023) can easily convert their site to take advantage of Web3 technology without the need for coding. With Meritocracy Plugin, Business owners that use WordPress websites can offer their services and products and have access to the Cryptocurrency Market, which represents around 1 Trillion Dollar Market Cap and in the case of NEAR Protocol more than 1 BILLION DOLLAR Market Cap. They can easily convert their sites to take advantage of Web3 technology without the need for coding.",https://www.facebook.com/Socialmeetclub,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Professional Services",1,Marilyn Betsabe Alvarado Quiroz,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,

Overlaying this system, and integral to it, is highly efficient use of solar PV, solar thermal, wind, in-line hydraulic kinetic energy capture and energy storage: to produce the lowest cost firm, on-demand 100% renewable power in any defined circumstance. The SWT System also works to absolutely limit evaporative water losses in every circumstance it engages: agricultural, storage, canal, riverine, urban municipal and rural. The SWT system achieves the most efficient production of plant proteins, plant starches and plant-based minerals and vitamins. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of fresh, organic vegetables, herbs, salad makings, vine fruit and cannabis. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of bio-plastics and plant-based materials. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of meat-based proteins and lipids. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of white fish and prawns. The SWT System allows treatment and recycling as potable, all municipal and mixed municipal-industrial wastewaters, as well as most industrial and mining wastewaters. It does so while generating a significant net profit on investment and operations absent any requirement for fees, tariffs or subsidies. The SWT System allows treatment and desalination-to-potable of brackish waters drawn from aquifers or agricultural runoff. It does so while generating a significant net profit on capital and operations absent any requirement for fees, tariffs or subsidies. Central to the SWT System is efficient breakdown and lysis of all volatile solids inputs and their subsequent phased-sequenced anaerobic digestion in a manner which allows efficient, parsed deployment of all inherent water, minerals, nutrients and energy. Nothing is thrown away or lost to the environment. A key system feature is intensive farming of plants of the Lemnaceae (sic: Lemnoideae popularly known as “duckweeds”) family within circumstances that: absolutely minimize evaporative losses of water; maintain temperatures within a favorable spectrum; allow CO2-enhancement of plant growth media (both air and water) and enable precise management of plant nutrition and photon irradiance. A key feature of the SWT System is use of abundant non-recyclable dirty and irregular plastic wastes, including thin film plastics, to produce highly robust molded, foamed paneling that can be employed structurally and as a floating platform for mounting PV panels, completely covering exposed water and thus preventing all evaporative losses.",,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agriculture and Farming, Manufacturing, Professional Services, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",2,"Mani Vannan, Paul Skillicorn",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,
