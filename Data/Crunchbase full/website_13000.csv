We are targeting restaurants, cafes, food trucks, and hotels. The idea of our application is to build the service when users can make orders in the restaurants, hotels, or from a food truck by scanning the QR code and will be redirected to the site/app to make a selection of the food. There are a few problems which we are solving with our application: 1. We are optimizing the time and effort spent by restaurants to train the personnel (waiters) and lowering the turnover 2. Reducing operational cost for the restaurants 3. Minimize interaction between people (orders will be taken through the app) which will be the huge benefit considering the current situation with a virus 4.  Regular customers of the restaurants don't need to wait until the waiter will come and could put the order immediately after they made a choice or skip the line and book the table before the visit. 5. Restaurants could provide a better consistent service by focusing on the food delivery to the table and presentation rather than on taking orders (waiter could be in a bad mood or tired which can impact the service, also for immigrants it's not always easy to put the order verbally) 6. Restaurants will get the analytics built on AI and ML, which will show their top menu items, their target audience, and will provide them with metrics and predictions which will impact how the business is done. 7. Food truck drivers could take orders online, and the line will be eliminated. Because the order is done online and the driver doesn't need to spend time on taking orders, he will be able to deliver more orders hence make more profit.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,3.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,3,2020,59662,False,False
