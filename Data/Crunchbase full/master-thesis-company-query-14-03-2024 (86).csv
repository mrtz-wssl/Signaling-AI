We empower the individual physicians to be the direct primary source of their identity and credentials by leveraging open standards based decentralized identity technology. The plan is for our cutting edge technology, built on open standards to be leveraged to usurp huge sectors of our $3.9T healthcare system. BACKGROUND: It currently takes 2 to 6 months to onboard and credential a physician. This process then has to be repeated every two years for compliance purposes. This problem costs up to $1 million for health systems, and physicians lose an average of $100K in potential income per onboarding credentialing event.  Until now there has been no verifiable trusted and user centric source of authentic data regarding physician credentialing. We make the practicing physician the primary source of their data fixing this problem permanently. Our system will streamline the on boarding process and will fix regulatory privacy compliance issues permanently. The HPEC application can allow physicians to prove their identity in a trusted way moving forward when they log in to healthcare applications like EHR, Telemedicine, and other systems that would benefit from identity verification. We raised $650K to fund development of HPEC, the physician facing credential wallet in 2020, and have completed and launched the MVP to the app store. While in development we realized, in order to keep HPEC viable and accessible we also needed to build the credential issuing system, so we founded evercred; to address a broader and more comercial market, and developed and launched that as well. We are now entering a seed round shortly to fund evercred which is the next phase of this project.",,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Leah Houston,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,
