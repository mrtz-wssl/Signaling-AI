Project management that people actually want to use. Taking a big picture view on the experience we have in working, Leantime steps away from the traditional approaches of task management and seeks to solve a bigger issue: How do we stay engaged and consistent with the purpose and value of our work?  Adoption of PM tools is often cumbersome and most people have a love-hate relationship with their tools. By incorporating AI and principles of neuroscience & behavioral science, Leantime works to make the work that a user is doing personal, easy (don't have to figure out workflows), goal focused and engaging.  Some of our features include: - Kanban, List, & Table views for To Dos - Subtasks & Dependencies with a visual Kanban overview - Goals - Idea Management - Milestones - Strategy Boards (SWOT, Business Model Canvas, Lean, +more) - High level strategic one pager  - Timesheets and time tracking  - Reports & Analytics - Retrospectives / Project reviews - Portfolio overview - Document & File management - ADHD friendly & inclusive reading themes - And more Now available in cloud: AI Beta (reach out if interested!)

One of the biggest challenges for 5G mm-Wave communication is transmitter power and efficiency. In most transceiver designs, power amplifiers (PAs) dominate the overall transmitter efficiency and thermal performance. It is extremely difficult to transmit a signal efficiently over the air at mm-Wave frequencies. To solve this, we developed an ultra-efficient silicon-based power amplifier (PA) topology for 5G mmWave applications called the Dual-Drive PA. For decades, the maximum theoretical efficiency of PAs has been fixed at 78.5%, with most PAs topping out at 40% efficiency. Until now, it was thought to be theoretically impossible to increase the efficiency beyond this figure of 78.5%. Our new, patented technology increases the theoretical maximum efficiency limits of PAs beyond 78.5%; therefore, no other PA can be as efficient as our Dual-Drive PA. Our first prototype was implemented using GlobalFoundries’ 45nm CMOS SOI process and was fully tested and verified. Based on our measurements, our first prototype achieves drain efficiencies that are 20% higher than any state-of-the-art power amplifier in the mmWave frequency range.  In addition, our technology was fully verified using the new 5G NR modulation testing standards achieving Gb/s data rates at incredible high efficiency levels. Since PAs dominate the overall transmitter efficiency and thermal performance, our PA technology can be employed by base station, cellphone, and radar manufacturers (to name a few) and decrease their thermal management cost and ease their overall system requirements.",,"Greater Atlanta Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hardware, Internet Services, Manufacturing, Mobile, Science and Engineering",1,Edgar Garay,1-10,3,Seed,2023-09-22,4000000,USD,4000000,Seed,4000000,USD,4000000,Seed,4000000,USD,4000000,4000000,USD,4000000,"Squadra Ventures, Asymmetry Ventures, Helium-3 Ventures",1,3,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,

At Caliber, we connect people with top fitness coaches, enable them to work out on their terms via our top-rated fitness app, and we integrate their fitness and nutritional data onto our platform to create a highly personalized, sticky experience. The result is that our members, on average, achieve at least a 20% improvement in their body composition – that’s their weight loss combined with muscle gain – in the first 3 months.  And thanks to working with a coach, our members complete 17 workouts a month, which is more than Peloton. We believe this is a huge opportunity.

It offers various features to overcome the common challenges faced by businesses including; disorganized work, lack of focus, miscommunication, uncertain team morale, and inadequate planning. With AI power, it plans your day for you. We believe that to achieve success as a team, it's important for each individual to effectively plan their day and adhere to the plan. During the planning stage, 3 main questions need to be answered: “what do I need to work on?”, “how long will it take?” and, “how much time do I have?”.  Planning is important, but not enough by itself for success. Individuals need to maintain their focus throughout the execution of the plan. For ultimate focus, it is essential to minimize the distractions caused by unnecessary messages, switching between unfinished tasks, and losing track of time. With BeforeSunset’s workspace, you can plan your day by reviewing yesterday’s achievements, and unfinished tasks. You can stay on schedule throughout the day by keeping track of time for each task and focusing on one task at a time.  By tracking the time spent on each task, you can ensure that work is progressing as planned and make adjustments as needed. With analytics provided by BeforeSunset close your day by reviewing and reflecting on the progress you made. This detailed daily and weekly analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and plan your future work accordingly. Since work is not all we have, it is important to include personal planning in your day to make sure your daily plan is accurate. This doesn’t mean all your teammates see your personal todos on BeforeSunset. Our tool has the capability to make todos private if the user chooses. BeforeSunset's ""Team Timeline"" feature is designed for team members to share updates with the team such as; the task they're currently working on, their availability, meeting status, daily mood, whether they're working remotely or on-site, and who is currently working or taking time off. This helps keep everyone on the same page, prevent miscommunication, and minimize the need for additional communication. To sustain and improve productivity, reflection is provided by BeforeSunset’s analytics. These reports include information such as completed vs. unfinished tasks, meeting analytics, mood analytics, and how much effort the team spent on each tag.",,"Greater Philadelphia Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Batuhan Ulasan, Ceylan Ersoy, Elif Duran",11-50,3,Seed,2023-11-09,25000,USD,25000,Pre-Seed,25000,USD,25000,Pre-Seed,350000,USD,350000,350000,USD,350000,"LAUNCH, Founder University",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-31.3%,19,,,,,,,,,,

IRON will allow gamers to not only purchase their favorite PC video games but also to sell them to other gamers on the Robot Cache platform. All of this is accomplished by expertly leveraging the power, flexibility, and transparency of blockchain technology.  Also, we are pioneering a new and exciting concept dubbed “Proof of Gaming.” Proof of Gaming will allow gamers to mine cryptocurrencies using our Robot Cache client, for which we will reward them with IRON. The Robot Cache client will also have a real-time tracker that allows gamers to see just how much IRON they will be rewarded for their mining.  If you want to find a large group with high-performance video graphics cards, then look no further than the PC video game community. Now, gamers can put their video graphics cards to use when they’re not playing their favorite games by checking a box in the Robot Cache client to opt-in to mine.

CAST AI's intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of the project, cluster, namespace, and deployment, down to individual microservices. CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster.
