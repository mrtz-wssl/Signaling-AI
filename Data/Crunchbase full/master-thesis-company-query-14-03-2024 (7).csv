The FORTE approach was invented by Dr Nat Ware as part of his Oxford PhD on a Rhodes Scholarship. With the FORTE approach, the cost of high-quality education (such as retraining) and healthcare (such as cataract eye surgery) is paid for by investors. Individuals who receive these services pay nothing - either now or in the future. Instead, investors receive a portion of any increase in future taxation revenue caused by those services. Think of it as ""Future Lydia's taxes paying for Present Lydia's training"". In a nutshell, it works in three steps: 1. Via Forte, investors can pay for the services of individuals who would otherwise be paying no or negligible tax. 2. These services (such as vocational retraining), by their nature, increase expected employment, incomes, and therefore government income tax revenue. 3. Governments, as part of the contractual arrangement, pass back to investors (via Forte) an agreed portion of the tax revenue attributable to the training recipients, for a set period of time. This arrangement is mutually beneficial.  Individuals receive training at no cost and with no risk. They just pay the usual tax rate. They’re effectively paying for their own training with their future tax. Governments pay nothing upfront. They can increase the skilled modern workforce, overcome skill gaps, and help those in need, without worsening the budget. Importantly, there are easy mathematical ways of structuring the contract so they only pass on in the future what they otherwise would not have had. In other words, the FORTE model pays for itself in a guaranteed way. Investors get low-risk, short-term returns. They can do well while doing good. There is perfect alignment of social impact and financial returns.

The company was founded in 2019 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.  Fast Company has recognized Stairwell as one of the most innovative companies of 2023. We're backed by an incredible lineup of partners, including Accel, Sequoia Capital, Gradient Ventures, and S32 -- not to mention angel investors like Eric Schmidt and Michael Ovitz. Let's imagine for a moment: What if you could deploy a full compromise assessment equivalent to an advanced incident response firm's typical three-week engagement -- for every file alert from your endpoint or SIEM? What if, within minutes of a new threat being reported – anything from supply chain attacks like 3CX or SolarWinds, the latest ransomware variant, or Log4j-style vulnerability – you received an authoritative, automated report on your organization's status regarding the threat? Either a completely ""clean bill of health"" or telling you that your organization WAS impacted, exactly WHERE, and exactly WHEN. Fully automated, powered by AI and machine learning, with absolute ""ground truth."" What if you had a neural network at your fingertips, capable of providing accurate threat evaluation, severity assessment, and tracking of not only a specific threat but all of its variants across your enterprise, instantaneously. What if you could write threat informed detections in YARA and run near instantaneously and continuously over every executable file that's ever been in your organization. Now, let's stop imagining, because Stairwell makes this a reality. We're amplifying capabilities across the board - from SOC analysts to threat hunters to incident responders - delivering the combined superpowers of a senior incident responder, a top-tier threat hunter, and a senior malware reverse engineer to every team member via an incredible automation solution.",https://www.facebook.com/InsideStairwell,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1,Mike Wiacek,11-50,5,Early Stage Venture,2022-10-11,45000000,USD,45000000,Series B,45000000,USD,45000000,Series B,69520000,USD,69520000,69520000,USD,69520000,"Sequoia Capital, Accel, Gradient Ventures, Section 32, Eric Schmidt",3,11,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-17.9%,60,,,26,2,3,Computing; Calculating,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

This means that it's our responsibility to figure out how we can collectively reduce the negative impact that these raw materials have on our planet. As a natural fiber processor, we work with farmers, manufacturers, and their suppliers to embed high-performance carbon-negative additives into various raw material supply chains.  Almost everything that can be seen or touched is made from plastic, rubber, foam, wood, paper, ceramic, or building materials.

Mitochondria are at the heart of complex life's origin. Likely a bacterium at the time, the would-be-organelle merged with a simple organism, entering into a symbiotic relationship: The mitochondria began supplying the energy for elaborate cellular functions to evolve, while the organism provided the mitochondria with an environment to thrive. Today, mitochondria are found in all human cells, except for red blood cells. They take on a pivotal role in cellular fate, as they produce most of the energy (ATP) and are involved in a large number of cellular and metabolic processes. The density of the organelles is particularly high in cells requiring a lot of cellular energy - e.g. cardiomyocytes or brain cells. Mitochondria function, and hence energy supply to the cell, may be impaired due to acute insults (e.g. ischemia) or genetic disorders (e.g. LOHN). Researchers at Harvard University developed an approach for mitochondria augmentation and replacement to ameliorate the damages from ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Ischemia is a lack of blood flow leading to an undersupply of oxygen and an impairment of mitochondria function. Reperfusion describes the re-introduction of blood flow, inducing an oversupply of oxygen. Both, ischemia and reperfusion, damage cells, with the mitochondria dysfunction being at the heart of the injury. The cascade of events, from ischemia to reperfusion, will eventually lead to cell death. The most prominent acute conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury are heart attacks. At Cellvie, we are developing a means to transplant viable mitochondria into the compromised cells, to interrupt the said cascade of events, re-enabling the cells to turn oxygen into energy via the mitochondria.",,"Greater Houston Area, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,"Alexander Schueller, James McCully, Pedro del Nido, Sitaram Emani",1-10,2,Seed,2023-02-06,5500000,USD,5500000,Seed,5500000,USD,5500000,Seed,10500000,USD,10500000,10500000,USD,10500000,"Taiho Ventures, KIZOO Technology Capital",2,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,2,0,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,,9291,USD,9291

In our quest to disrupt traditional healthcare – advancing it from the hospital, to home, to hand – we developed a groundbreaking solution to enable anyone with a smartphone to measure their ‘Vital Signs from Video Selfies’. From a simple 10-second face scan, our technology extracts 5 vital signs (heart rate, blood oxygen, pupillary reflex, eye saccades, hand tremor) – all familiar to clinicians for decades – to obtain insights into all 3 vital organs:  heart, lung, and brain.  We call this our ""Healthy Selfie,"" which you ironically naturally capture every day. After 40,000 hours of R&D, our AI-powered digital biomarker platform can now measure all 5 vital signs with a clinical validation accuracy over 90%, fortified by 7 utility patents, globally pending.   BioTrillion's longer-term roadmap is to digitally map the entire human body by developing more digital biomarkers to simultaneously measure additional vital signs, all from the same Healthy Selfie video – accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
