Commoot brings “awareness to the road” by utilizing unused advertising space on the trailers of semi-trucks, box trucks, and large vehicles. Graphic, eye-catching “billboard-like” ads are attached to trailers through heat-wrapped vinyl or a ‘poster’ framing system. Commoot helps brands by supporting brand awareness initiatives, as well as creating a stronger and more tactical campaign for clients. Beyond becoming a new platform for OOH media, Commoot plans to innovate in a few other ways. Commoot is one of the first platforms to allow quick and seamless OOH campaign creation through a marketplace website. Commoot is currently building proprietary technology that can track a very large amount of data through camera technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and geographical information systems, and more. Our technology can allow corporations, cities, and other organizations to make major decisions more easily through the use of our data.  How Commoot Benefits Brands Commoot benefits brands by ensuring their ad messaging reaches audiences more frequently, for longer, and in a way that does not allow the user to become “blind” to the ad message. Commoot takes your Out of Home marketing budgets further with more insight than traditional billboards can provide. Commoot benefits brands of all sizes grow their awareness and convert new customers by reaching them where other mediums of advertising simply can not. How Commoot Benefits Trucking Companies Commoot partners with trucking companies and fleet owners across the country to lease their unused white space on the sides of their shipping containers. Trucking companies and fleet owners benefit from increased revenue, which can be extremely impactful in today’s current economy. No need to worry about the ‘logistics’ of ad placement. Commoot does all the work for you, while helping you earn more revenue from your unused ad space. How Commoot Benefits Marketing Agencies Commoot allows Marketing Agencies to provide their clients with a powerful form of Out of Home (OOH) marketing and branding. Commoot provides real, actionable data to further supplement their marketing campaigns. Agencies can bring unique, exciting advertising and branding opportunities to their clients in ways that traditional Billboards cannot.  Stronger, more memorable ads = Higher ROI Learn More Why Commoot Works Commoot provides brands with longer impression exposure to customers, ads that are closer to consumers, larger ad spaces, and more data to support the advertisements. Different from Competition Refresh and reawaken the impression-based ad space by limiting competition and emphasizing ad retention. Move away from the cluttered online ad market and move towards an exciting, unique OOH campaign. Keeping Ads Fresh Most forms of advertising fall victim to “ad blindness”, which occurs when viewers have become too accustomed to seeing the same advertisements. Commoot solves this issue by working with a continuously moving medium, ensuring less ad blindness and continuous exposure to new audiences. Economic Growth By partnering with smaller trucking firms and fleet owners, we enable economic growth by providing an additional source of revenue for trucking operations. This keeps the operation more stable during volatile times. Data Others Can’t Provide By utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence, Commoot goes above and beyond what other competitors can offer. We ‘digitize’ impression-based advertising with AI learning, making it simple and easy to deliver incredible, high-performing ads. Less Distracting Than Billboards Billboards force drivers to look 100s of feet away from the road to receive the message of the ad. Billboards are often distracting, and only hold the audience’s attention for 3-5 seconds. Commoot brings the advertisement to eye level with the driver, ensuring that their eyes are not taken off the road and the ad is seen for 10+ seconds.

Things like, training location, team flight, a welcome video, photos, and more! They can also see some really useful coach information like coach gender, coach license type, and a series of tags that highlight the areas the coach specializes in.  Sports Bridge helps coaches have a much better online presence. Currently, individual teams are hidden or buried deep in the club’s online directory and coaches rarely have customizable assets for these directories, with Sports Bridge individual coaches can really put their best foot forward with their team profiles and show off what makes them great. With Sports Bridge coaches can create their teams in minutes, post a recruitment listing and sit back and watch their requests come in. Once those requests start coming in, coaches can manage them in the dedicated requests tab in their dashboard. They can add notes, change tags, and see all the parent information, no more scanning through messages trying to remember who’s interested in a tryout or not.  Parents with the help of useful filters have the ease to simply search for what they are looking for, not what Google thinks they might be interested in, or what the Facebook algorithm deems useful for them. With Sports Bridge, parents can truly do their due diligence on teams they are interested in before enquiring about a tryout. They can open a side-by-side comparison view of up to three teams for at-a-glance viewing, save their favorites and easily send a tryout request all at no cost to the parents.  Never before have we seen coach information for a youth sports team. A coach can make or break a youth sports team and there’s so little information about individual teams’ coaches and what little information you can find is either outdated or not relevant.

We are targeting restaurants, cafes, food trucks, and hotels. The idea of our application is to build the service when users can make orders in the restaurants, hotels, or from a food truck by scanning the QR code and will be redirected to the site/app to make a selection of the food. There are a few problems which we are solving with our application: 1. We are optimizing the time and effort spent by restaurants to train the personnel (waiters) and lowering the turnover 2. Reducing operational cost for the restaurants 3. Minimize interaction between people (orders will be taken through the app) which will be the huge benefit considering the current situation with a virus 4.  Regular customers of the restaurants don't need to wait until the waiter will come and could put the order immediately after they made a choice or skip the line and book the table before the visit. 5. Restaurants could provide a better consistent service by focusing on the food delivery to the table and presentation rather than on taking orders (waiter could be in a bad mood or tired which can impact the service, also for immigrants it's not always easy to put the order verbally) 6. Restaurants will get the analytics built on AI and ML, which will show their top menu items, their target audience, and will provide them with metrics and predictions which will impact how the business is done. 7. Food truck drivers could take orders online, and the line will be eliminated. Because the order is done online and the driver doesn't need to spend time on taking orders, he will be able to deliver more orders hence make more profit.",,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",3,"Alex Pashkevych, Roman Hamretskyi, Yaroslav Masiuk",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,
