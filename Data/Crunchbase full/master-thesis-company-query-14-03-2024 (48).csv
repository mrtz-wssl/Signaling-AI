We were amazed at how many people in a transaction, tenant, broker, landlord, all mentioned deposits and financial worthiness as massive friction points in a deal. We saw how cash deposits felt wasteful, losing money against inflation! We heard about how letters of credit required onerous provisions that essentially locked a businesses cash up anyway…so we built a better solution. The Otso Guarantee. We formed Otso to solve a real problem with the way commercial leasing assesses credit, mitigates risk and ultimately stockpiles capital in “dead” accounts that loses money for everyone.  Our program is built to provide Tenants with the flexibility to access and leverage their capital on day one of their lease, for anything…from a nicer space to more equipment and hiring. For Landlords, it made little to no sense to use critical cash for a business to mitigate risk years down the road…and to be frank, it doesn’t do much to mitigate that risk anyway. Our program issues “same as cash” guarantees for our approved tenants that give Landlords comfort while providing their Tenants with a greater lease experience, right from the start. As we grow, Otso will blend into a larger vision we hold at Tenavox, where friction is reduced and transparency allows for quicker, better lease decisions for everyone.",https://www.facebook.com/otsocorp,"Greater Houston Area, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Real Estate",3,"Frank Rogers, Josh Feinberg, Marissa Limsiaco",1-10,2,Seed,2021-04-20,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,"Quake Capital Partners, Second Century Ventures, Sputnik ATX, RealCoAccelerator",1,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,
