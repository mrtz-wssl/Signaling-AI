By proxying requests to databases and APIs and inspecting their schemas and payloads, JumpWire automatically identifies fields that need special handling. JumpWire will transform the data in place (for example encrypting any field that is classified as PII). This ensures that further processing or storage won’t risk leaking the data in its raw form inadvertently. A common use case for JumpWire is moving data between internal databases and tools for analytics and customer support. In this scenario, specific columns (such as those corresponding to PII) may need special handling before loading into another tool with a more permissive access concept. JumpWire installs on-premise or inside our customer’s own cloud, so there is no dependency on a third party or concern with sharing data outside the network.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Other, Privacy and Security, Software",3,"Ryan Cooke, William Huba, William Huba",1-10,1,,2022-03-22,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,USD,,,USD,,Y Combinator,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,

Important works that have been absent from the scholarly record can now be accessible, safe, and permanently available. How we do it (with community) We’ve created a series of websites, called Commons, that bring together licensed materials, wild content, and tools for researchers, librarians, and students. Commons members share, suggest, upload, and contribute. The sites are created, improved, and grown collaboratively—with communities of librarians, expert researchers, and publishers. What we’ve achieved so far Students and researchers from hundreds of institutions across six continents use our Commons.

These standards are fundamental in providing individual wallets for any NFT and, consequently, making the web3 world ripe for reaching the masses.             OctacoreAI takes a two-pronged approach:             1. OctaMind - AI Driven Development: It is chatbot for AI-driven development for Web3 using Octacore's APIs and SDKs. OctaMind is designed to handle Web3 specific queries and help developers understand web3 concepts, how to build web3 projects using Octacore including step-by-step guides, code snippets and help with any queries related to Octacore's products and services.

This model fetches on-chain data and renders a button to execute transactions to fulfil all your Web 3 needs including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and so much more.              Additionally, you can also integrate Szabo into your platform to give your users the power to converse to your platform and construct custom and complex transaction and that they can execute right during conversation, GASLESSLY.             The core technology empowers three integral layers of Octacore:                          IDENTITY LAYER: Simplifies user onboarding to dApps with a PLUG-N-PLAY infrastructure, offering customized solutions like Social Login, Smart Login, and TBA Login.                          APPLICATION LAYER: Streamlines the development process by providing ready-to-deploy, audited Templates and Suites of Smart Contracts, and assists in managing roles, upgrades, and other smart contract interactions.                          DATA LAYER: Offers fast and reliable data through APIs, SDKs, and Webhooks, eliminating the need for node management and intricate blockchain development knowledge.
