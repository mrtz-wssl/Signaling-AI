Herbfluence provides a platform that allows brands in and related to the cannabis industry to find, connect with, and advertise through cannabis related social media influencers. Herbfluence thrives on our proprietary technology, a robust network of cannabis social media influencers, an easy-to-use self service platform, exceptional customer service, and an incredible team with over 25 years experience in the cannabis industry. For brands in the cannabis industry, digital advertising opportunities are extremely limited. Google, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter all currently ban advertising for cannabis related companies. Companies are forced to rely upon outdated forms of advertising such as magazines, tv, radio, and billboards. Despite the limited advertising channels available, many cannabis brands have started to use influencer marketing as an effective means of digital marketing. Although it has proven to be very effective, many companies are unable to implement successful influencer marketing campaigns. Finding, connecting, negotiating, and compensating influencers can be an extremely tedious and timely process which often results in a low return on investment and ultimately a waste of time and money for a brand’s marketing department. Their solution is to offer an easy-to-use self-service platform that allows brands to connect with a network of cannabis-related social media influencers to promote products and services to cannabis consumers directly on their mobile devices. Our platform will streamline the process of finding, connecting, negotiating with, and compensating influencers. Herbfluence’s target market consists of brands of all sizes that are interested in advertising their products and services to cannabis consumers through social media influencer marketing. Whether it is a small company such as a medical dispensary, smoke lounge, retail shop or a large brand such as a food and beverage company, our goal is to bring them in as a customer and provide them with the highest quality social influencer platform that will give them the highest return on investment for their marketing efforts.",https://www.facebook.com/Herbfluence-2129692503755430/,"East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing",1,Tyler Knight,1-10,2,Seed,2019-08-01,20000,USD,20000,Seed,20000,USD,20000,Seed,120000,USD,120000,120000,USD,120000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,

Most likely your business is going to bring your products and services to your customers doorstep. However, straight away you’re faced with a complex problem… should you develop an expensive software solution or, do you use what’s on the shelf and put the extra time and resources into growing your core business idea? Unfortunately, what’s on the shelf won’t give you a competitive advantage against the larger companies that have hand built their own solution. Without a custom solution you simply won’t be efficient enough to survive in the long term. This is where fieldd comes in! Fieldd powers your mobile services that travel to your customer’s home or work, and does so in a way that gives your customers the impression that you have hand built your own custom solution. Fieldd is different to other platforms because fieldd focuses on automating and prioritizing the customer experience. From the moment your customers book your services online, they are guided through a unique customer experience to turn them into a customer for life. Other platforms simply hold your customers’ details and often are no better than an address book. This unique “loop” to keep your customers engaged isn’t possible on other platforms and companies are forced to use a range of solutions to get the job done. Why hasn’t this been done before? Put simply, building fieldd has been a hard process! After 3 years of initial R&D & 30,000+ live R&D bookings, fieldd was launched in 2019 and now is the software of choice in 15 countries across 20 different industries. 15 years ago the thought of McDonald’s delivering your food was a futuristic thought. Today with the latest technology, UberEats has made this idea an everyday solution. 15 years ago the thought of catching a taxi was also not an everyday solution due to the inconvenience of booking, tracking & paying for your taxi. Yet today, technology has pushed taxis to become an everyday solution. The demand for customer convenience has always been on the rise and with COVID, this need has been supercharged even further. 100% of the time customers will instantly book the best priced, fastest service provider to come to them. Yet 98% of businesses rely on a 15 year old quote request form with a 1-5 day reply time. Before Uber entered the taxi & food industry, these two industries represented industries that were waiting to be optimized with technology. The amount of other service industries that are currently highly inconvenient and can be optimized, is practically endless. Prior to fieldd, the automation and customization within fieldd that are included with every plan, were only possible with custom software development. Now, it’s possible with a click of a button. Every day we are unlocking hidden potential in field service businesses globally, we look forward to seeing your business do the same.",https://www.facebook.com/fieldd.co,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Mobile, Platforms, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,

Audio Design Desk,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/audio-design-desk,2018-01-01,month,"Audio, Film, Music, Software, Video Editing","West Hollywood, California, United States",Audio Design Desk is an AI-Assisted content creation tool.,"233,372",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://add.app,https://twitter.com/audiodesigndesk,https://linkedin.com/audiodesigndesk,"Audio Design Desk is an AI-Assisted content creation tool that reinvents the process of connecting audio to video, turning hours of frustrating work into minutes of inspired fun. It is an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing how sound for video is produced, refined and delivered. Our powerful AI engine notices users’ likes and dislikes, so over time, Audio Design Desk gets to know each user’s taste. It comes bundled with over 20,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, which makes our groundbreaking technology possible. Audio Design Desk’s intuitive and innovative content creation tools empower filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software. Here’s how it works: Every sound in the add.app library is assigned identifying characteristics and carries an embedded sync point, which means that as sounds are previewed and chosen, they automatically land on the timeline in the exact right position relative to the video. The user simply imports a video file into the app and presses keys on their keyboard—H for hits, R for rises, D for drones, or users can assign sets of sounds to their numeric keys. The user can then strike the keys to position sound elements in real-time while watching the video playback—in effect, using the QWERTY keyboard like a Smart Sampler. For users who would rather select audio manually, add.app can search, audition and place sounds right from the timeline, completely eliminating the need to parse through libraries, import sounds and then find where they sync. Once a composition is set, add.app understands where sound connects to video and, by adjusting replacement criteria such as intensity, complexity, genre or feel, Audio Design Desk can use its Sonic Intelligence™ to instantly turn a single composition into infinite alternates without losing sync. Perhaps the most mind-blowing of all, add.app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and has built the foundation for Machine Learning (ML) to understand which sounds a user likes and which sounds they reject so, over time, add.app will learn and adjust to its user’s taste.  add.app seamlessly integrates with the industry’s leading NLE software, including Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple Final Cut Pro, Apple Logic, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Pro Tools, and Avid Media Composer, with frame.io integration coming soon. add.app also works with hardware controllers like the Elgato Stream Deck, which makes the process of adding sound effects via keystrokes even easier.  Audio Design Desk is a SXSW Innovation Awards Finalist and winner of a 2020 NAB Show / Pro Sound News Best of Show Award. Already being used by editors at Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Originals, add.app is fueling creativity everywhere. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING Academy Award-nominated editor Matthew Cooke: “There isn't another piece of software that allows you to instantly create at this level of professionalism.” Sound Effects Editor of ZERO DARK THIRTY Jamie Hardt: “Audio Design Desk is the tool I’ve been looking for my entire career.” Mix Magazine: “Expertly designed,” “groundbreaking application that significantly speeds up the act of accurately adding sound effects and music to picture” ProAudioFiles: “A new paradigm for audio post production” Redshark News: “A breathtakingly effective idea for sound designers” Pro Video Coalition: “Represents an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation—or DAW—that uses AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, editors, sound designers and creators to produce cinema-quality sound in seconds""",https://facebook.com/audiodesigndesk,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Software, Video",3,"Gabriel Cowan, Ryan Francesconi, Samuel Music",1-10,1,,2021-01-01,,,,Non-equity Assistance,,,,,,,,,USD,,Creative Destruction Lab (CDL),1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75.58%,5,,,,,,,,,,

It provides embedded finance services allowing clients to open digital wallets for their users and to manage them using application programming interface (API) integration. As a BaaS provider, Whillet handles all licensing requirements, relieving the client of that responsibility.     The fintech solution from Whillet enables across the board installation and support for all processes. This includes websites, apps, marketplaces and other platforms set up for client users, facilitating such things as bank accounts, electronic money accounts and bonus accounts.   Customer wallets can be accessed in a variety of ways, such as via a mobile app or through a website. The embedded finance technology allows clients to substantially increase revenue and improve unit economy indicators.   A good example of how Whillet works is by employing multilevel processing solutions for loyalty programs while, simultaneously, partners get easy management of customized loyalty programs, thereby rewarding regular users with bonuses and real money which they can spend on further purchases.   Multi-billing facilities enable payments to be distributed among all participants in the sales process - the customer, suppliers, store (or site), couriers, and so on. This automated system saves companies time for pursuing more important strategic tasks.   A branded, customized wallet can include any methods of depositing and withdrawing money that the customer chooses. Debit and credit cards, mobile payments, e-money, transfer money providers, and so on. All of the above will be provided as an integrated link in the customer's account. Whillet's prime focus is on the B2B and B2C markets. The company works with marketplaces, sharing platforms, retail chains of various sizes, car dealerships, insurance and travel companies, postal service providers, contractor-user and production-delivery-customer models, car parkings, fines payments, license acquisitions, online stores, freelance exchanges, taxi companies, and gas stations - the list of possible uses just goes on and on.
