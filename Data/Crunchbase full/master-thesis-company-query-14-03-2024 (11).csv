Nearly all solid cancers grow faster than their blood supply, leading to regions of low oxygen in the tumors and HIF activation. The HIFs in turn induce the expression of over 100 genes that help tumor cells survive and spread. OncoSpherix has several classes of small molecules that block activation of HIF-1 through novel mechanisms. OncoSpherix’s lead clinical candiate has been shown in mouse models to reduce primary tumor growth, inhibit metastases, and prolong survival in many types of cancer (glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, uveal melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer).

The BlinkLab smartphone application enables remote neurobehavioral testing in children and adults to help diagnose and monitor neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. The app can also be used in neuroscience and psychology research to study fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation. Until now, these tests have required dedicated hardware in a permanent lab environment with substantial face-to-face interaction between researcher and participant. The new app is user-friendly, especially for infants and autistic patients since no face attachments are needed. The BlinkLab smartphone app allows performance of neurobehavioral tests remotely using the user’s own cell phone. Anyone can do the tests by themselves at home following the user-friendly instructions provide by the app. Experiments can be programmed by the healthcare professionals or researchers and selected from a list on the smartphone by the user. Data acquired with BlinkLab can be securely shared with healthcare professionals or researchers During a typical evaluation, the user will watch an entertaining movie or play a simple video game on the smartphone, while the smartphone delivers short auditory and visual stimuli in specific patterns. A test takes about 10-20 minutes. Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, BlinkLab will measure the motor and emotional responses of the user to these stimuli. For most experiments, the main focus will be on eye movements and eye blinks.

The platform gives users core atomic functionality out-of-the-box that vastly improves overall performance for portfolio managers who want to deploy capital strategically and efficiently. No subscription or registration is required to get started. If funds are held in MPC wallets like Fireblocks or Qredo, traders simply connect to the platform via WalletConnect or Metamask. Traders rely on Dexible full life cycle trade support for their dex swaps and accounting management. Dexible's 7 order types draw inspiration from those offered in traditional finance including TWAP/DCA, Stop Limit, Stop Loss, Take Profit, and Limit Orders. The Dexible aggregator pulls liquidity from 57 AMMs to make swaps possible and uses a smart order router to determine the best pricing across 5 different networks. Automated trading leads to far superior outcomes for strategies trading in long-tail assets. Some unique use cases the platform introduces include rug pull protection, buying dips in prices, price bounded Dollar Cost Averaging, minimizing transaction fees, preserving profits, and illiquid market swaps. The Dexible team repurposed infrastructure from a signals composition engine designed for Ethereum devs into automated trading after the CDL accelerator in the summer of 2020. Today, Dexible's infrastructure evaluates multichain market conditions 24/7. The platform automatically evaluates parent orders and splits up the total input to reduce total swap slippage by up to 30%.

ARED started as a Research Lab in 2013, our goal was to help bridge the digital divide that affects over 4 billion people across the world. Most of the investment in the digital divide is focused on bandwidth, yet most of the storage and computing power is controlled by 3 main companies and centralized infrastructure is very expensive. Also, most of the smartphones in developing countries are low-end smartphones with low internal memory and low processing power that accentuate the digital divide. Finally, lack of energy access is a huge problem, if you do not have electricity at home you cannot charge your phone and use it the way you want, also building storage and computing power solution require energy that is why at ARED we use renewable energy.  To solve this digital divide, ARED developed a mini-server platform to store digital applications closer to the users and minimize the cost of the internet, and we developed a solar kiosk platform to power the technology but also provide additional services such as phone charging to become a one-stop-shop platform.  We spent 6 years developing the technology, and in 2020 we started piloting our technology in 6 African countries with local partners (Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Burkinafaso, and Ivory Coast).

Our first product--Canopy Hero Pro--is the best positioned solution in the emerging multi-billion-dollar market for reusable respiratory protection in healthcare. Our patented, see-through filtration system is safer, more cost effective, comfortable, and environmentally friendly than disposable N95s. Only 3 other companies worldwide have approved products in this category (all legacy 'gas mask' designs for industrial use), and Canopy is poised to become the first with a clean-sheet design for use in healthcare. Our made-in-Vermont product exceeds all federal safety standards, we’re fulfilling DTC orders with an NPS score that smokes the competition, and through a strategic commercialization partnership, we have a B2B pipeline of the largest health systems in the US (and NHS in the UK) eager to pilot Canopy upon regulatory approval.
