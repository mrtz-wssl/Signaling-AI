Based on 20+ years of research from the University of Washington (UW), our hybrid organic electro-optic technology enables low-voltage, low-power, high-performance transfer of data between electronics (the ubiquitous computer chip) and photonics (the technology used in fiber optics, LIDAR, and other groundbreaking technologies). NLM’s technology enables tighter and more efficient integration of electronics and ultra-fast photonics.  NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology is a patented combination of materials and process technologies, enabling efficient EO modulation in datacenter and computing hardware that meets the demand of future growth in networking for AI and other applications. Photonics is transforming networking, computing, and sensing. The largest use to date has been for data transmission and networking in telecom and datacenter infrastructure, using light to efficiently move data over fiber optic networks. Silicon photonics is the incumbent platform for integrated photonics in datacenter network hardware, but signal conversion between electronics and photonics on this platform is power-hungry and cannot scale to sufficient bandwidth to meet future needs in AI and other applications. This has created a need for alternative electro-optic (EO) modulation technologies that can be integrated with silicon photonics and address this bottleneck. Alternate emerging modulation technologies have limitations in bandwidth, device footprint, thermal stability, or cost and complexity of integration with silicon photonics and conventional CMOS VLSI electronics. NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology uniquely solves these issues. It can be retrofitted into silicon photonics processes in late-stage advanced packaging steps, minimize changes to complex chipmaking processes and infrastructure while providing superior modulator power efficiency (10-1000×) and enabling scalable bandwidth. The technology can be deployed through multiple fabs as a semiconductor IP block for broad reach, and has been demonstrated at leading translational research fabs, leading to extensive recent interest by hyperscale datacenter operators and commercial fabs. NLM’s deployment is also accelerated by strategic investors including TOK (a major photoresist manufacturer with extensive materials supply agreements with fabs) and photonics components leader Hamamatsu Photonics.",,"Greater Seattle Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Science and Engineering",5,"Bruce Robinson, Ph.D., Delwin L.

Simbo does not train its own LLMs but enriches existing LLMs of the choice with its proprietary Symbolic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture.  Symbolic RAG is a perfect combination of LLM and symbolic knowledge bases for hallucination-free Gen AI platform for enterprise applications. As a specialized use case, Simbo is using its Gen AI platform for medical practice automation. It helps healthcare providers reduce burnout and costs, by automating mundane tasks using proprietary Lossless clinical NLU. Simbo AI is currently automating following use cases: - AI Medical Scribe as an API: Simbo sends patient conversation transcript to all well known LLMs from AWS, Azure, and open-source LLMs and uses proprietary clinical note ranking algorithm to identify the best clinical note. Our algorithm optimizes the cost as well to ensure it fits the budget. - Autonomous AI Phone triage bot: Triages the patients on inbound and outbound calls to autonomously resolve tasks. It helps reduce burden on healthcare staff and reduce cost for medical practice. Simbo has invented a groundbreaking concept known as 'Lossless NLU,' powered by our proprietary BISLU platform. Lossless NLU takes text or voice input and transforms it into a structured meaning representation called Thought Representations, without losing any part of the meaning. In contrast to prevailing NLU methods that primarily predict intent and entities, Lossless NLU retains the full context.

As a result, only 16% of lung cancers are found at an early stage and the current 5-year survival rate is < 20%. Recent changes to lung cancer screening guidelines have illuminated a path to improving outcomes in lung cancer. However, these advances rely on excising suspicious nodules and providing sufficient tissue for definitive diagnosis. We believe this is the missing piece of the puzzle, and physicians need a new generation of surgical oncology tools for lung cancer.

The FORTE approach was invented by Dr Nat Ware as part of his Oxford PhD on a Rhodes Scholarship. With the FORTE approach, the cost of high-quality education (such as retraining) and healthcare (such as cataract eye surgery) is paid for by investors. Individuals who receive these services pay nothing - either now or in the future. Instead, investors receive a portion of any increase in future taxation revenue caused by those services. Think of it as ""Future Lydia's taxes paying for Present Lydia's training"". In a nutshell, it works in three steps: 1. Via Forte, investors can pay for the services of individuals who would otherwise be paying no or negligible tax. 2. These services (such as vocational retraining), by their nature, increase expected employment, incomes, and therefore government income tax revenue. 3. Governments, as part of the contractual arrangement, pass back to investors (via Forte) an agreed portion of the tax revenue attributable to the training recipients, for a set period of time. This arrangement is mutually beneficial.  Individuals receive training at no cost and with no risk. They just pay the usual tax rate. They’re effectively paying for their own training with their future tax. Governments pay nothing upfront. They can increase the skilled modern workforce, overcome skill gaps, and help those in need, without worsening the budget. Importantly, there are easy mathematical ways of structuring the contract so they only pass on in the future what they otherwise would not have had. In other words, the FORTE model pays for itself in a guaranteed way. Investors get low-risk, short-term returns. They can do well while doing good. There is perfect alignment of social impact and financial returns.
