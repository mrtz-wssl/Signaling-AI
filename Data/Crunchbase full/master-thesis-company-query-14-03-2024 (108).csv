Our vision of financial success is made possible by combining small efforts of a large group of people with the help of reliable technology. In the words of John D. Rockefeller's, “I would rather earn 1% off a 100 people's efforts than 100% of my own efforts”. The main question that made us design Solomon Mines was how to make your savings grow in a safe and fast way, along with that, how to make savings work and earn extra income in a low-risk environment. Based on the extensive financial trading experience of our founders, we came up with a solution: invest your money in gold and make it work through networking.  Traditionally, gold has been considered a conservative financial instrument. In the context of extreme stock market volatility, the benefits of the physical gold market have become more and more lucrative.  We chose gold because it's a safe way to keep your savings. We believe that networking is the best way to build up your business. Our Referral Rewards Program puts your savings to work for you, making gold a profitable financial tool accessible to everyone. One can purchase as little as 2 ounces of gold to qualify for entry into the program. And by referring new members, you get a commission from the investments of your members.  We chose a Referral Rewards Program because it’s a fast way to generate more income. Solomon Mines is a safe and fast way to earn more money.",https://www.facebook.com/solomon.gold.mines/,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Financial Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44,,,,,,,,,,

Entrepreneurs receive poor advice and really no mentoring on their journey and as such are forced to pay the tuition of the school of hard knocks which is extremely expensive.   Founded by a serial entrepreneur whose businesses make $5 million a year annually and as someone who has both succeeded and failed at multiple businesses, our mission is to guide and mentor business owners so that they can create their dream business and life. Too many business gurus preach that success in business is tied to just one thing, some say it's sales, others online marketing, social media, some say its finance, others swear by good management principles, but in reality it's a combination of each of these items and putting them all together in a working puzzle we call the 7 Figures growth algorithm.   When business owners harness the power of the growth algorithm within 7 Figures U their chance of building a 7 figures business increase dramatically.
