Hospitals send 1.4 million patients home for 4-6 weeks to administer their own IV antibiotics every year. Twenty percent of patients on outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) are readmitted, each costing $80,000 on average. This is a $22.4 billion problem. Clinicians at the 12,200 home infusion providers in the US have no objective way to identify non-adherence to intervene and prevent readmissions. Rather, they call patients to detect non-adherence, which is time-consuming, inaccurate, and prone to reporting bias. They need a better tool than a phone to monitor adherence.  The solution is HIVE’s patent pending CloudConnect smart catheter. CloudConnect is a reinvented IV line with a simple embedded mechanoelectrical sensor that detects when a medication source is connected. CloudConnect wirelessly sends this information to electronic medical records. HIVE’s value proposition is that clinicians can detect non-adherence in real time and make treatment decisions and prevent costly readmissions based on objective data.

Itoric,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/itoric,2019-02-01,day,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Intelligent Systems, Machine Learning, Medical, Predictive Analytics, Text Analytics","Plano, Texas, United States",Creating a machine of general purpose intelligence targeted to intelligence analysis and system controls.,"1,605,257",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://HL-Intel.com/,,,"Itoric has developed a linguistics-based platform on which it is building a system of general intelligence.  Its core is based in linguistics, enabling it to go where AI cannot readily go and do what AI cannot possibly do.  It skirts the current industry paradigm of creating software-based products whose logic is based on a human programmer's knowledge and ability.  We have dubbed this new realm 'Human-Like Intelligence' (HLI).  The HLI 'agent' is trained in English rather than with numbers and data.  For analysis and problem solving, it does not use scripted or programmed methods. For its enabling technology, Itoric has one patent issued, one pending and another in process . HLI contrasts with AI-based intelligent systems is that it quite accurately mimics human thinking.  Traditional situationally-dependent programming or scripting is not used, neither by Itoric nor the end customer.  HLI instead depends upon English-language teaching, back-stories, observations and situational briefings.  Itoric's HLI is Subject-Matter Expert (SME) trained, something for which no equivalent exits under the AI paradigms of the past 70 years.  For autonomous systems, the accuracy and completeness of an HLI's assessments and decisions are driven by the completeness of its text-based training.  Unlike programmed autonomous systems, performance does not depend on how accurately software requirements were defined or how insightful its programmers were. Beginning in 2013, the founder created new IP for a method of storing concepts and knowledge in a now-patented specific form of data graph.  Access to the HLI's gained knowledge is linguistics-based, and every neuron in it is self-describing, in English.  Its internal data graph design allows for rapid multi-dimensional accesses of concepts and knowledge.  With superior linguistic approaches, it understands every-day nuanced meanings and purpose for every word in a sentence or fragment of speech.  Concepts in its graph-like memory are learned, managed and updated primarily in ordinary English.  Training is text-based, created by subject-matter experts, whether dealing with how to walk or the implications of human action.  The enabling technology was its patented neuron structure that each represents a single concept.  With this, the creation of a robust English parser and related semantic analyzer were possible. The analysis of external text's emotional content is a natural byproduct of the HLI's semantic analyzer, as it the very concept of topic.  Both of these are difficult for conventional systems, as is the correct interpretation of colloquial idioms in context.  Here, they are natural outcomes flowing from the semantic analyzer. Many fundamental paradigms, tenants and methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are demonstrated to be self-limiting and self-perpetuating.  They have confined Artificial Intelligence to niches far removed from the original lofty dreams of a ""general intelligence"".  That is, AI cannot be applied almost anywhere human-like intelligence is needed, whereas Itoric's HLI system can be.  The timeframe for AI arriving at such an inflection of general intelligence remains 20 years distant, a prognostic delayed year over year. In its persistence, Itoric has overcome high barriers to entry for general intelligence, having solved intractable unbounded problems.  The HLI is *not* bio-mimetic.  Rather, the psycho-mimetic nature of the Visel Mind Model readily handles cultural idioms, regional culture, human values, political issues, and even the broken English that makes up today's (English) communication.  The initial target market for Itoric's HLI are the autonomous analysis of intelligence, finding its implications, and the control of systems where a human in the loop is not practical.  A general manager from one of the three-letter agencies disagreed with the founders assessment as to the HLI's market estimate of $200B.  He insisted that the more realistic estimate is $3T.  The founder has since come to ready agreement with that assessment. The development status of the HLI is currently Technology Readiness Level 5 or 6 (TRL 5 or TRL6) for the framework, parser and semantic analyzer.  The HLI's mind model  operates on low power and modest memory resources, not the estimated tera-flops needed for AI. Itoric will be seeking about $10M and about 18 months to deliver a first-generation product to the initial Intelligence or aerospace industries.",,"Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Thomas Visel,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,
