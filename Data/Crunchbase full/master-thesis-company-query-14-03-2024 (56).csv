We're a peer-to-peer marketplace for buying, selling, and exchanging unique services and experiences. Tell me more! Services can be anything from housekeeping or logo design to a video chat with a chef helping you perfect your favorite recipe. The goal is to connect people who need help with something to someone who is available to help them. What's the story behind it? MyPeople was an idea that came to our Founder & CEO, Melissa Strawn, while she was a struggling single mom in the Bay Area with two kids to support. A short-term disability left her unable to work and she dreamt up a creative way to get her needs met while still being a valuable contributor to the economy. Melissa and her husband now have five sons and need a community of help more than ever before! They utilize the services of many of the helpers on the site and still provide services of their own. Why is this so important to you? Glad you asked! Not everyone fits into the typical workplace model. Some people have disabilities, familial responsibilities, or lack access to skills or transportation to get to the jobs that will pay them what they need. And some people just want to call their own shots! We are building a trusted community of people who offer their unique skills, talents, and services so that we can see a world where all people can earn a living doing only what they love. This comes with the bonus of knowing that you are helping lighten the load of someone else.",https://www.facebook.com/MyPeopleNow/,"Greater Seattle Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Internet Services, Other, Transportation",1,Melissa Strawn,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,

This idea quickly grew into what is now known as Giffywalls - providing customizable walls made out of vinyl wallpaper that can be personalized according to your needs the way up at affordable prices while still maintaining high-quality standards customers love so much about us!! The story of Giffywalls is one that began many years ago. The founder, Dipan and Pathik Patel had their roots in art from as far back as 1999 with Bhunesh Art; they later founded another company called Vasudev Image which designs spaces using handmade pieces or other decorated items like walls and so on - all related to creativity! The Two Brothers team has always been creative, from their early days of starting new and advanced technology companies to now as innovators in the worldwide market for quality products. They soon learned about digital printing techniques but were still amazed by what could be done with these advancements when they chose Giffywalls - a company that focuses solely on online shopping walls! This business specializes mainly in wallpapering & Other Home Decor products; it's not just another print shop where you get your picture taken once and then put up onto something else without any customization options available.",https://www.facebook.com/giffywalls/,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Design, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,467.04%,5,,,,,,,,,,
