As AI expands, consumer products and services will be reshaped completely. AI has the potential to give mass consumption apps a huge pick-me-up: these are the kinds of tools we are developing in our studio. We are constructing our latest project from the ground up: optimizing a consumer app by leveraging the power that lies at the intersection between AI and social behaviors. The Apply AI studio team has history in Latin America but have relocated to Silicon Valley. We have been building products for the social web since 2005, when we started Taringa.net, an intelligence collective social network. Our team has worked together for the past 10 years building what grew to become the largest social network ever created in Latin America with millions of users worldwide.  In many LATAM countries, Taringa is the second largest social network, just after Facebook and ahead of Twitter. Also, Taringa was the very first massive consumer platform to incorporate bitcoin as a way to share revenues within its community. Today, our team is taking advantage of the benefits of AI technology by building a wide array of new AI tools and applying them to new products,  such as Gif Surfer, a gif discovery platform which uses AI specifically for image recognition and AI machine learning and big data, in order to identify content and serve Gifs that we can guarantee users will love.

Lodestar lets you drag and drop hours of video and start annotating right away. It continuously trains a custom AI as you label. The AI automatically predicts labels, greatly speeding up the work. As the AI gets more accurate, so do the labels, so the annotation team can generate more labels faster than ever. The custom AI also drives our active learning system that automatically finds objects buried in hours of video and queues up the frames for the team to check. It adds the most helpful frames to the top of the queue, so the dataset gains the most valuable data first, and the model gets better faster. Finally, integrated dataset management and data science tools allow data scientists to run experiments and validate the dataset by training inference models in parallel with the labeling effort. No wasted time and money creating labels that aren't adding value to the dataset. Today, training a computer vision model can take months of multiple cycles of labeling, exporting, training a model, analyzing the results, and starting again to achieve success. Lodestar changes all that. Our advanced platform for labeling and training with native video support trains a model in real time and allows your teams to work in parallel.

While most solution providers focus on easing the returns process, we offer an alternative. Decipher the reasons for those returns in time to take corrective action and prevent them from happening in the first place. With AI, natural language processing and prescriptive analytics, retailers reduce product returns and create a sustainable and more efficient business for their customers, the environment, and the bottom line. “CEOs have to think differently. CEOs need to quit focusing on just top line sales and look at the middle of the P&L. Returns are a big portion there.” – Mike Relich, co-CEO PACSUN “Returns are the most expensive and time-consuming element of the life cycle of a product. If you’re interested in profitability, returns reduction needs to be a top priority.” – Chrissy Ginieczki, COO Title Nine “What we’ve learned is that close to 70% of consumer returns are driven by factors that are controllable by the retailer. Let’s say we could solve just 1/4 of those controllable issues and shave 3 points off that return rate. For a $1B retailer, that’s a $30M reduction in returns. That certainly gets my attention if I’m a CFO.” – Scott Glaser, CFO, formerly of Ascena Retail Group “When you're planning and say, okay, I'm going to buy this much. And I know that a certain percentage of it's going to be returned and I'm going to get a margin hit on that. That's the way it used to be, but it can be different.” – Diane Randolph, CIO, formerly of ULTA & Reitmans “The sensitivity of the customers towards the product is heightened by the fact that it's not really needed in some cases. If I really love it, am I going to wear it? Am I going to use it? And if not, am I going to send it back?

Millions more people, particularly in the developing countries, can be immunized, saving tens of thousands of labor years through worldwide vaccination campaigns. Vaccine Systems creates equipment to help with this, resulting in increased access to vaccines, simplified preparation, and an essential margin of safety for those prepared at the point of care. At the same time, we reduce vaccine waste – which the WHO claims varies from 30% to 70% – and suboptimal vaccine re-allocation.",,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,2,,2022-05-19,1500,USD,1500,Grant,,,,,,,,1500,USD,1500,"MassChallenge, Texas A&M Innovation",2,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,

These parameters are unacceptable for manned and autonomous transportation in cities. That is arise the following problems for manned navigation: skipping proper turns and making wrong turns, getting on improper driveway or taking false exit on road junctions, loss of navigation and jumps of position in: urban canyons, financial districts, sky scrapers blocks, narrow and dense built areas; loss of navigation and incorrect positioning in city tunnels, nearby viaducts and overpasses, absence of navigation inside underground, under roof, multilevel parking lots, no seamless outdoor/indoor navigation. All mentioned issues makes customers unsure and unsatisfied. Autonomous/self-driving From the autonomous/self-driving point of view the goals are: decimeter grade of absolute positioning within a global reference frame, relative localization/location displacement estimation accuracy – 10 cm per 100 sec, speed estimation accuracy – 5 cm/sec, course estimation accuracy – 0,1-0,5 deg. Effective integration of navigation and machine control information sources as GNSS, IMU (gyro, accelerometer), 3D compass, Digital Map, Radar, Lidar, Image-based Positioning and Computer Vision. Solution to the navigation/positioning task mainly within GNSS+IMU+3DMap+Image-based Positioning techs. To allocate the Computer Vision and Radar/Lidar techs mostly for obstacle avoidance, objects recognition and machine control functions. Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic approach to urban mobility and autonomous/self-driving technology solution concludes in deep engineering synthetic navigation design consist of: tight couple integration of GNSS with internal sensors (IMU) using raw data of satellite receiver, map based corrections (road graph and turns matching), image-based positioning (reference points detection and images recognition; no permanent scene analysis typical for obstacle avoidance, no high power and computation consumption). The software only product using just a platform sensors running on smartphones and in-dash auto systems. Auto insurance Auto insurance problem: it is a must to have precise motion trajectories of manned and autonomous vehicles’ in absolute and relative coordinates in case of collision happened. Traditional and unmanned vehicles collide today and will collide in future for various reasons. Perfectly reconstructed trajectories based on robust motion data opens the opportunity for automatic arbitration and resolution of road traffic incidents and accidents. Achievable centimeter accuracy of relative and decimeter accuracy of absolute positioning is the core technology for automatic collisions arbitration. High labor costs of “manual” non-automatic settlement of traffic accidents and insurance cases nowadays. Bottom line: no clear picture of road traffic accident, no data to judge who is responsible for crash, no data for crash analysis.  Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic’s auto insurance technology solution is founded on: precise relative positioning (estimation of the location displacement) based on phase measurements of GNSS and transferring to absolute coordinates using map matching methods and image-based positioning. Here we use applied measurements: GNSS raw data, primarily the accumulated phases and MEMS IMU sensors, image frames from camera. Dynamic adaptation of data processing based on a constant analysis of consistency of measurements from the phase tracking channels. Exact reconstruction of vehicles’ trajectories based on entire set of kinematic parameters including accelerations, velocities and angular velocities. Hereby we have opened the opportunity for automatic arbitration of road traffic accidents, cut costs of insurance companies, save time and money for drivers. Demonstration of results The video of the technology real time tests on Android smartphone will be demonstrated in the frame of presentation. Interested customers will be welcome for field tests.
