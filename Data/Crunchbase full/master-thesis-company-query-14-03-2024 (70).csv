More people are blogging than ever. But at the same time, more people today prefer to listen rather than read. So, we thought: What if bloggers could offer a way for people to listen to their content? Converting a written blog to a podcast involves what’s known as text-to-speech. But text-to-speech alone cannot create podcasts that connect with people. Good podcasts need more than a voice to tell the story: They need music and rhythm to create an emotional impact. That’s why we came up with BuildBubbles. It’s a web app that can help bloggers easily make awesome podcasts without a microphone or studio equipment. Bloggers do not even need to know how to edit the podcast. BuildBubbles converts written blog posts into compelling podcasts with sound design! With BuildBubbles, your blog will stand out and you’ll reach a much wider audience. As a content provider, you spend a lot of time creating interesting content. Make sure it reaches as many people as possible! BuildBubbles is easy and intuitive. Just three steps and a few minutes and it’s done! 1. Paste a link of your WordPress blog post you’d like to convert to a podcast 2. Choose the BuildBubbles podcast template and voices you want 3. Edit your podcast if you wish. Once you’re finished, you can download it or embed it in your blog. Please try it!

Mobile teams frequently rely on phone calls and emails to communicate everything: Schedules, updates, documentation, pictures...the list goes on. Phone calls are siloed, only reaching those on the call. Emails are not made for instant communication and are messy when chains become long.  Cockpit Mobile's ""Field General"" creates instant messaging channels for each project. This help teams communicate in an organized fashion and also automatically documents correspondence into a master job file. A critical aspect of Field General is the ability to add subcontractors and clients to these instant messaging channels - traditional instant messaging such as Slack silo companies and make this difficult. Field General has 2 main use cases: venue/event management and delivery procurement.  Venue/event management consists of uploading a floorplan or layout and adding team members to that event. Management & staff can drag & drop virtual task lists across this map, pinning them to certain areas.  In real-time, the team is updated and can see what needs to be done, exactly where it needs to be done. They simply check off the item & can post proof of completion, helping their management and fellow team members understand progress and more efficiently execute. This has application in big box retail, construction, concerts, festivals, theme parks, campuses, and more. Our delivery module help bring the Uber feel to any home service or delivery (cable installation, mattress delivery, etc.). 4 hour windows are turned into real-time ETA notifications and a GPS view of the technician en route to your residence. The ability to instant message directly with the technician and drop a pin helps increase satisfaction for both parties.

Their journey began with the challenges they faced in the North Dakota oil fields, where misplacing a unit or not tracking its runtime could result in several additional hours of travel. Their quest for a suitable telematics solution led them to try five different companies, but none met their expectations in terms of affordability and compatibility with their diverse fleet. Dissatisfied with the available options, they took matters into their own hands and crafted the telematics system they had envisioned. This system, Clear Telematics, is a GPS telematics device paired with fleet monitoring software, tailored to meet the practical needs of equipment owners without breaking the bank. What sets Clear Telematics apart is its affordability compared to other IoT fleet management solutions and its user-friendly design. Users can monitor vehicles, equipment, and machinery from various manufacturers all on a single dashboard. This includes heavy machinery, construction equipment, and commercial vans. Additionally, Clear Telematics offers an open API, allowing businesses to integrate their telematics data with their existing management software. The system is designed to be straightforward and durable, avoiding unnecessary features that could complicate the user experience and increase costs. At its core, Clear Telematics aims to provide essential data at a price point that ensures a tangible return on investment for its users.",,"Greater Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Internet Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,
