While the basics of most solar energy systems and somewhat easy to comprehend, assuring the installation of an appropriate array designed to meet specific customer’s needs can be difficult and costly, especially with a growing number of variously qualified service providers. Southern New Mexico-based owners and licensed contractors with New Mexico Water and Electric are not only fully qualified and experienced with the installation of all types of solar energy systems, they are fully versed in both the benefits and often misleading information relating to the current federal rebate program and other available support for customers. New Mexico Water and Electric also reminds our potential customers how the installation of most residential systems will involve a considerable amount of roof work. This factor makes it critical to make sure the installation process is not only professionally executed, but also raises questions about how non-local firms might respond, or not respond when eventual roofing repairs or replacement becomes necessary. NMWE customers secure a reliable connection for followup repairs, maintenance assistance, and other services by our experts. Whether your looking to supplement power for your home or business, or looking to install a system to be completely independent from the power grid, New Mexico Water and Electric is fully qualified and prepared to help you realize your goals.",https://www.facebook.com/NewMexicoWaterandElectric,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we continue to expand our brand, we remain committed to respecting our values and providing an alternative lifestyle of being mindful and seeking better when it comes to what we put on and in our bodies. As the world continues to navigate the most health-sensitive year in history, the question plaguing our minds is how cautious we can be to protect ourselves. When the COVID-19 crisis started, it became clear that the ingredients we use every day need to be evaluated for not only effectiveness but overall health safety. With everyone creating more and more products to be used in the fight against disease and germs, we at The Mentis Company took a different approach in the way we selected ingredients for our customers. About six months into the pandemic, supplies were running out in the stores, and we were forced to get creative when it came to sanitizing. But when we went through the common items needed to make the typical sanitizing cleansers, many of them became unappealing when you looked at how toxic they are, especially when you begin to breathe in those chemicals. So, we took matters into our own hands and set our sights on curating a cleanser that helps without harm. With extensive research, we landed on a key component that works for the skin in ways that harsh chemicals cannot. As the world continues to navigate the most health-sensitive year in history, the question plagued how cautious we can be to protect ourselves. While the year 2020 was underway, it became clear that the ingredients we use every day need to be evaluated for not only effectiveness but overall safety health.
