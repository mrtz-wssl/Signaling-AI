Brownie points were an imaginary social currency earned through good deeds done to others. Over the years, a community and cryptocurrency has been established around this idea. Brownie coins were created as a reward system when someone does something deserving a reward. Initially, Brownie points were awarded as novelty points without any monetary value.  Post world war II, brownie stamps were given depending on the purchase of goods. These stamps could later be redeemed for select goods. Brownie stamps or brownie points, were a resemblance of a good deed performed in the society and rewards for purchases made. Brownie points have since carried on to represent a remittance system with a monetary value attached to each coin earned. Brownie coins have established themselves as part of the cryptocurrency and blockchain narrative that forms a significant part of today’s economy. Brownie coins are an opensource digital currency. Instead of awarding someone brownie points with no value, brownie coins now offer a monetary value.  About Armen Merikyan Armen Merikyan grew up in Los Angeles California, a software designer and a crypto currency early adopter. He is the founder of Brownie Coins which is a digital currency platform. He commenced his venture while working in one of the three biggest entertainment studios in LA, such as Walt Disney, Warner Brothers etc... His passion regarding attempting to actualize bitcoin reproduction was complex as he had no insight of the technical world of crypto currency and blockchain technology. He worked in Silicon Valley where he approached numerous individuals to create a model for a given timetable, price and a full operational help group around the product. He secured funding from his parents, family and friends. This seed money assisted him with creating brownie coins as fully developed digital currency.",,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Armen Merikyan,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,

This trend in turn leads to an increase in the number of people requiring long-term skilled care (LTSC), which includes home care, hospices, nursing homes, and assisted living centers. One of the most common issues in LTSC settings is falls. One in every 3 people older than 65 years is estimated to fall 1 or more times each year. Fall death rates among adults age 65 and older increased more than 30% from 2007 to 2016. Every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall. Falls in older adults are not only risky, but also costly. In 2019, falls of US residents aged 65 or older led to $51B in medical costs, with $39B paid for by Medicare/Medicaid and $12B paid by private entities. Falls are also the 2nd largest reason for lawsuits against LTSCs. Heron Point Tech’s Fall Prevention System allows assisted living facilities to preemptively and continuously detect residents who are likely to fall. As opposed to most fall-related systems, our system doesn’t detect falls - it stops them from happening in the first place. By using our camera-based system to track resident walking patterns/gaits, residents are assigned weekly fall risk scores.
