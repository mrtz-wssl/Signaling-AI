After I told a friend and spared him the hours of work by guiding him through it, another friend asked me the same thing. I did the same for him, and I ended up teaching a bunch of my friends. They where all curious and wanted to get in, but the process is not intuitive. I made it easy for them and now they are all trading. So, the idea behind this site is to take the pain out of it getting into the crypto currency market space. That’s what inspired me to start this site.

About BoatBold Our mission is two-fold; first we want to make the boat rental process as easy and painless as possible. Secondly, we want to help boat owners have more than just two happy days. We want to make every day owning a boat as happy as the first day you bought it by turning your boat into a money maker that covers it's own expenses. BoatBold is a startup boat rental marketplace based in Rochester, Minnesota. In 2018, BoatBold founder Tim Robinson, an Air Force Veteran and RCTC Computer Science student decided to enter the Student Division of the Minnesota Cup to improve his professional and technical experience, while going to school and building a tech company in southern Minnesota.  Tim launched the BoatBold web application on May 3rd, 2018 to allow boat owners to list their boats for rent and allowing boat renters a place to easily review and compare the features of available boats. BoatBold is focused on freshwater boat rentals some of the things that differentiate us from our competitors are our focused on lake-based search for boats, focus on smaller boats and land based pickup and shipping of boat rentals. (Meaning that you can rent someone's boat, even if it is parked in their driveway on a boat trailer.) BoatBold is a big supporter of building technology companies anywhere and hopes to eventually employ more people in Southern Minnesota. Minnesota is a great place to start a boat rental startup as 15% of Minnesotan's own boats, store boats, and pay for expenses for boats, despite having one of the shortest boating seasons. At 15% boat ownership, Minnesota has the greatest boat ownership per capita in the USA. We believe this makes it a unique environment to build considerable supply of boat owners on our platform and encourage boat sharing to alleviate the expenses of boat ownership while providing renters with an easy, friendly boat rental experience.  Our largest competition which is focused on renting larger boats on the coasts has only 4,000 boats on their platform, and very few in Minnesota, while the state of Minnesota boats over 813,000 boats.  BoatBold makes everyday a happy day for boat owners!

The site lets users create their own ideal marriage contract and search for compatible partners. Contracts can stipulate anything and everything from childcare and housework, to expected lifestyle and partner income. What is Yakukon Contract? The contract is a detailed document that describes exactly what you can bring to a marriage partnership, and exactly what you expect of your partner. Once done, you search for compatible contracts among other users and other users can search for you. When a user finds a contract they like, they can submit a proposal – a modified (or unmodified) version of their contract – to that user. When users receive a proposal, they can either accept it, reject it, or send a counter offer – an edited version of the proposal they received. Users can go back and forth with counter offers as long as they wish. Once a user accepts a proposal, contact information is exchanged. Then the two users meetup and take things from there. Can I use Yakukon to create a prenuptial agreement? Yes. When you have a successful match on Keiyaku Kekkon, you and your match will have a single unified contract. You can print this out at any time. If you want to make it legally binding, you and your new partner should both modify and sign the final document, ideally with witnesses present. This signed document can then be added to a traditional marriage agreement and approved by your local authorities. Through our system, we hope to make marriage a reality for people frustrated with traditional dating sites.
