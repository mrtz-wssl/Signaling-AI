Upper cervical chiropractors differ from general chiropractors in that they focus on the top two vertebrae instead of working on the entire spine and broader spinal manipulations.

Start pregaming your next party, trip or night out with friends now, to enjoy the future in the present. Slap is more useful than a group chat, but more fun than a calendar. -- Half the fun of doing something is the anticipation of doing it, but who likes to make plans? It can be such a hacked together hassle across too many apps, so we decided to fix that. We've turned the map into a video-based social calendar with group chat that captures future plans with a collaborative ""group event story""™ consisting of a Video Invite® + Video RSVPs. Imagine a fun video walkie talkie-like experience. There are plenty of invite services that ‘list’ who’s coming to your party or event but none of them ‘show you’ who’s coming and how excited they are to join in. Have a good time between the good times with Slap. Watch the hype and momentum build for what you and your friends are looking forward to doing. ****************** How to use Slap? ****************** Slap: Bored? Record a Slap (Video Invite®) to start a ""group event story""™ telling your friends or the world what you want to do. Personalize them with Lenses powered by Snap AR. Then pin the location of where you’ll be and when on your map. Explore: Looking for something to do? Surf the Slap Map to see what your friends have posted they’ll be doing. Don't miss out, event stories disappear 24 hours after the fun starts in real life. Slap back: Find something interesting to do? Slap back by recording a Video RSVP to tell your friends you’re in. Start enjoying the anticipation as the Slaps start coming in and you see how psyched everyone is. Messaging: Once you Slap back that you'll be joining in, you'll unlock the group event chat with everyone else who will be going to what's being planned before, during and after the event. **************** When all of your favorite people are sharing and discovering things for you to join in on, life will get a lot more interesting and memorable. That’s our vision and we appreciate you helping to spread the word with your closest friends. We’ve worked hard to bring you Slap and we're having a lot of fun doing it. We would love to hear what you like, don’t like or want to see in the future. Thanks in advance for letting us know at: helpme@slap.events.

Just two files; no questions asked about the deep net architecture or training parameters! In a day's time, you will receive a page of simple, highly-efficient C code that does not even read like a deep net.
