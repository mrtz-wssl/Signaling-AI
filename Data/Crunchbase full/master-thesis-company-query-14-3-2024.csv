Since cell therapy is currently produced for a single patient at a time, it is expensive to manufacture, requiring significant time and resources, and is difficult to scale.

Compared with the current manual manufacturing processes for cell therapy, the Cell Shuttle’s next-generation automated manufacturing solution has 10 times the scalability (meaning 10 times more patient doses can be produced simultaneously), enables a three-fold reduction in process failure rates, and will reduce the per-patient manufacturing cost by up to 70 percent for most processes.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",3,"Alex Pesch, Fabian Gerlinghaus, Omar Kurdi",101-250,3,Late Stage Venture,2023-08-23,255000000,USD,255000000,Series C,255000000,USD,255000000,Series C,355000000,USD,355000000,355000000,USD,355000000,"Bristol-Myers Squibb, 8VC, DFJ Growth, EcoR1 Capital, Decheng Capital",3,9,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2021-10-11,,,-46.05%,6,,,,6,10,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,246374,USD,246374

The Analog tech stack consists of the Timechain (a consensus-agnostic protocol maintained by a dynamic and decentralized validator set), developer toolkits, and APIs—all designed to break down the barriers of cross-chain communication. The Watch SDK, a Web3 data infrastructure toolkit for deploying and querying data from connected chains, is among the first developer toolkits built on top of the Timechain. To enhance the overall UX when it comes to querying blockchain data, the Analog team has implemented a low-code and intuitive platform called the Watch UI that runs on top of the Watch SDK called the Watch UI. Developers can use these tools to deploy and explore quickly and query on-chain data from any connected network via a unified API. To progress towards a permissionless interoperable Web3 future, Analog intends to extend the capabilities of the Watch SDK to include cross-chain smart contract execution calls by implementing a General Message Passing (GMP) SDK. The GMP SDK will provide developers with a simple framework for building cross-chain applications that extend beyond token transfers. Besides providing interoperability functionality, Analog also offers the Timegraph SDK that makes it easy for users/applications to query any blockchain data via an intuitive and unified interface (Timegraph API).

There is more than one American Dream. Owning your home is one of those dreams. It's been an aspiration for a long time, and we know that millions struggle to achieve it. But there are other American Dreams. Some of these dreams are about living differently than previous generations - for whom owning was everything. We may want to use our cash to start a business. We may want to experience new places. We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging. This is a new mindset. We are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms ""landlord""​ and ""tenant""​ don’t apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them. Our owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants. We manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character. Before, renters often felt like second-class citizens; with us, they are an immediate and integral part of the community. So, whether you own property and you're looking for someone to live in it and love it, or you're looking for a home where you can put down roots – for however long you're planning to be there – we are the answer.

The proliferation of connected devices promises to revolutionize consumer, commercial and industrial applications with greater convenience, lower operational costs and data-driven performance improvements. Already consumers have fallen in love with smart home conveniences, while many businesses have begun to reap the benefits of connected device driven efficiency gains such as electronic shelf labels and occupancy sensors. Giga scale applications for these technologies are around the corner: the potential exists for billions of wireless sensors to be installed during the coming decade, with nearly half located inside buildings. However, the challenge of reliably and affordably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale. Connected electronics require continuous power, which until now has meant batteries that must be periodically replaced or recharged. Legacy photovoltaic technologies like amorphous silicon cells long used on solar calculators and childrens toys don’t yield sufficient power in the real-world, low light operational conditions for most IoT sensors. At the same time, the exorbitant price tag for high performance, low-light PV technologies like gallium arsenide cells has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics.
