We’ve spent hundreds of hours talking with builders around the world and trying to understand their daily frictions. Each conversation seems to light a spark. Ask a new question. Focus our attention. Ultimately, these conversations are why we built StruxHub. Repeatedly, we saw that—no matter where you were in the world, how progressive the contractor, how critical the job—Projects still suffered from unplanned delivery trucks showing up and waiting for hours on the street to get on site. This daily chaos was disrupting work and was costing builders time and money. When digging into why this was happening, we found that it was simply that general contractors lacked access to the right tools. Paper forms and whiteboards simply didn’t match the speed and agility needed in orchestrating the real-time coordination needed on complex jobsites. This discovery eventually allowed us to articulate our broader mission at StruxHub; that is, to help builders build better—with greater transparency, with less waste, and with more consistent outcomes. Despite all the activity in construction tech, there is still an enormous opportunity to better serve the day-to-day operational needs of construction professionals in the field. So to all of the builders out there, we at StruxHub just wanted to let you know that we hear you. And we’re looking forward to walking your jobsite with you.
