The process of customer identification should be transparent and simple for shoppers as one click, allowing businesses to combine all data silos into one tool that can bring together transaction information and customer data. Major point-of-sale (POS) providers are investing millions of dollars in improving their credit card processing part of the business, but there is little focus on customer identification and getting those customers to come back and shop more, increasing their average ticket value. We have taken on the difficult task of building the first platform that takes over the core customer identification experience. We connect all data from online and offline customer touchpoints into one single tool, allowing businesses to not only accurately identify their best customers, but also understand their purchase preferences and habits in order to embrace the entire customer experience and convert first-time shoppers into loyal fans, increase customer lifetime value, and drive more revenue for the business.

Market leaders, despite their dominance, are now experiencing unprecedented churn and this is because they’ve failed to meet the evolving expectations of their user base. As long term automation users ourselves, we've faced the same issues; high-friction setups, temperamental workflows, and being limited to simple, partial processes. Essentially, it boils down to; usability, reliability, and scalability. The proof is in the data. According to PWC, 69% of automation initiatives fail to execute due to complexity, and of those that do, another 50% then fail later on due to reliability and scalability issues. Clearly there’s an industry-wide problem here. doFlo, powered by asynchronous event streaming technology and AI, addresses these gaps and is so compelling that we’re seeing, not churned, but existing automation users move to doFlo. So what does it look like? Our workflow editor is drag and drop, it’s no code and uses simple annotations in English to create automations for you. It’s easy, if you can plot a flow chart, you can make sophisticated workflows that never fail, in minutes. We plan to maneuver from SMB to mid-market and enterprise, but first we must segment. Our ICP is the unaddressed real estate market, sold via self-service for bottom-up scaling. After monopolizing this, we'll then expand horizontally into more competitive markets. Our competitors serve basic process needs for SMB customers quite well, but their mid-market and enterprise customers seek more scalable and sophisticated workflows. doFlo’s limitless scalability means we meet these expectations perfectly. Our business model is simple. It’s to offer a superior, affordable product for our customers with higher margins for us and our pricing model scales on automation connections and storage capacity. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this. In fact, the doFlo founders have seen repeated success. Across our 12 years together, we’ve founded a number of successful companies, which includes a notable exit to Avast in 2018. doFlo is making good progress so far. We recently hit $5K MRR from our paid pilot program that we opened in December, have 100 accounts on our waiting list, and plan for GA in March 2024.",https://www.facebook.com/doFloInc,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Thomas Maarseveen, William Butler",1-10,1,Seed,2023-07-21,250000,USD,250000,Pre-Seed,250000,USD,250000,Pre-Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,

Our technology provides instant event status delivery and event ownership updates throughout the whole network along with distributed levels of access to functional system modules without cluttering the bandwidth between the nodes. Instead of storing the data directly in the blockchain, Tectum stores hashes that are mapped back to the original data stored at a lower level. This isolates the heavy transaction-related data from the main pipeline by hashing, encrypting and signing the bundles at the end of every transaction and archiving it. This makes the event-related data instantly verifiable and publicly accessible, with different levels of accessibility provided to different transaction-related modules. The event hashing process is run on top of a database in order to enable faster retrieval of data items, and works as an upper functional layer to keep the main-net pipeline free from heavy data processing. The mechanism of isolating the system event formalization process from big-data leading to the main-net unprecedented throughput capabilities is our value proposition. Normally, the rule of thumb for a blockchain is that the greater the security, the slower it is. Conversely, if you want a fast blockchain, you’re going to have security issues, because everything comes with a cost.

They users of social media have no choice but to have their online experience dictated to them by other users & businesses as they push their opinions, politics, humor, ads, and more out to the world with little regard for the psychological effect that content and privacy-abusing advertising can have on people and society as a whole. It’s for these reasons that over half of all Americans agree that social media is a negative influence on the world. Businesses’ (especially SMBs) only way of knowing when and why people are interested in their products is reactively, once they have been exposed to their advertising. These companies are losing out on a completely untapped area of business-to-customer communication where, preemptively, companies are able to generate revenue from customers who have never interacted with their advertising in any way.  Solution: WhoYou allows users to have complete control over their social media experience because, for the user, YOU are the master of the content that you see, hear, and feel. You are able to pull out the information from other users that you’re interested in, freeing you from the incessant negativity that is now available. For businesses, user’s cynical insinuations caused by your advertising will disappear, as you will be able to communicate in a real, unobtrusive human manner with those people most interested in the products and services that you provide, in a completely preemptive manner. This is a completely new way to connect and it’s not just exciting because it’s different, it’s exciting because it’s better.bio, pictures, other searches).
