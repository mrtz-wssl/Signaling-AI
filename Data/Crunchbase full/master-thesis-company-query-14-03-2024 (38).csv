The insurance maze has left many feeling lost, unheard, and undervalued. That's why Ivyngton is here to chart a new course. Ivyngton transforms the insurance landscape with an innovative AI-enabled approach. Personalizing each policy: Everyone is unique, with distinct needs and concerns. At Ivyngton, we believe your insurance should reflect just that. Instead of providing a generic policy, our advanced 63B parameter insurance quote model is designed to understand and cater to your specific requirements. This not only ensures that you're covered for what truly matters to you but also provides us with precise insights into the risk profiles of the policies we craft for each individual. Assured insurance: We are the only insurance company which will pay your claim even if the underwriter refuses to. If your claim isn't paid by our underwriters, we step in. Our legal team fights for all unpaid claims, no matter how small, and we charge only 20% of the recovered amount. Lower risk: Instead of confusing terms and hidden fees like traditional insurance companies, we only take 30% of premiums as profit and give the remaining 70% to our underwriters. In return, these underwriters shoulder 100% of the risk. AI-categorized policies: By harnessing the power of our models, we offer underwriters precise risk categorization for millions of personalized policies. This means faster approvals, fewer denials, and more accurate pricing for customers. Transparent, accessible, and efficient: Our customer dashboard is an instant one-stop-shop for all of your policies, whether taken out by you or your employer, saving you time and stress, allowing you easy one-click claims and one-click access of all of your documents.

Their first product, the CryptoBioSecure™ is a hardware “cold” fingerprint wallet that addresses specific needs of digital currency owners with biometric authentication for accessing a user’s cryptocurrency account without the need for passwords. The user’s fingerprint is captured with highly sophisticated encryption and uses this algorithm as the password, phrase, pin and seed. One of the most compelling features of the fingerprint wallet is not just the ability to identify the owner’s fingerprint, but also determine if the input is from that live person. The fingerprint reader in their fingerprint wallet is so technologically advanced that it can actually read the pulse and blood flow of a fingerprint to verify that the authentication is from a live person, and not just an image of their fingerprint. They feel capacitive biometrics will be the future method of authorization for many applications ranging from credit card payments to rental cars and medical records. ITBiometrics™ will be at the forefront of all efforts to improve security, reduce risk, and deliver a seamless and convenient user experience in all areas where identification is critical.

Concurrently, Monolith will enable investors to create and manage their “Own Hedge Fund Portfolio”, via a compliant platform for primary offerings and secondary exchange transactions. The platform empowers investment advisors, accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers to help formulate their own market hypothesis. This allows the investor to create and manage their own “Personalized Hedge Fund Portfolio” in the alternative investment space from commercial real estate investments, asset-back securities, structured products, mature private PRE-IPO companies, etc. Ultimately, we are building four major revenue streams, with each stream having multiple revenue points and some having recurring revenue streams: Monolith Investment Banking, Monlith2 Real Markets, Monolith Investment Banking Structured Products, and Monolith Investment Banking Private Funds. We are building, where few exist today, an ecosystem that modernizes the capital markets using blockchain-digital-ledger technology and smart contracts via our own Digital Investment Bank and Capital Markets Firm. Our mission is to bring “liquidity rights” to alternative investments. We seek to modernize the primary and secondary capital markets for leading investors, issuers, and sponsors.

A broad range of investors including asset managers will desire these modern securities for helping to assign “fair value” and possibly providing enhanced efficient liquidity solutions and markets.

As a pioneer in the field, Entar specializes in harnessing the power of blockchain to back digital assets with physical real estate, opening up a realm of golden opportunities for home buyers, sellers, renters, landlords, investors and the market alike. At the forefront of Entar's offerings is the groundbreaking concept of real estate tokenization. This process involves converting the value of physical properties into digital tokens on the blockchain, thereby revolutionizing the way investors can access and interact with the real estate market. These digital assets offer enhanced accessibility, liquidity, and divisibility, making real estate investment more democratic and adaptable to individual needs. In addition to physical real estate, Entar is a key player in the burgeoning world of virtual real estate. The company develops and manages digital properties in virtual environments, providing unique opportunities for businesses and individuals to own, trade, and invest in virtual spaces. This aspect of their business taps into the growing trend of the metaverse and virtual worlds, where digital real estate is becoming as valuable as its physical counterpart. AI plays a central role in Entar's strategy, particularly in the analysis and utilization of real estate data. By employing sophisticated AI algorithms, Entar can analyze vast amounts of data related to market trends, property values, and investment opportunities. This AI-driven approach enables more accurate predictions and smarter decision-making in real estate investments, benefiting both individual investors and the industry as a whole. Furthermore, Entar’s AI capabilities extend to enhancing customer experiences and operational efficiencies. AI-powered tools assist in automating routine tasks, managing properties, and providing personalized recommendations and insights to clients, thereby elevating the overall service quality. Entar's expertise is not limited to technology. The company's leadership comprises seasoned professionals from the real estate, fintech, and tech industries, ensuring a well-rounded and forward-thinking approach to business. Their commitment to innovation is matched by a dedication to ethical practices and regulatory compliance, particularly in the rapidly evolving digital and virtual real estate spaces. Entar is a dynamic force in the real estate and fintech industries, specializing in the integration of AI, blockchain, digital and virtual real estate, and advanced data analytics. Its visionary approach to blending physical and digital realms, along with its commitment to innovation and ethical practices, positions it as a leader in shaping the future of real estate investment and management. Corey Chambers, the esteemed founder of Entar and a noted real estate broker, has demonstrated a remarkable commitment to community service through his philanthropic endeavors. In a commendable initiative, Chambers spearheaded a fundraising campaign aiming to raise $25,000 for the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, a facility renowned for its exceptional care and support for young patients. This initiative reflects Chambers' deep-rooted dedication to making a positive impact beyond the realms of business and real estate. His efforts in organizing and promoting this fundraiser highlight his compassionate approach and his desire to give back to the community, particularly to support the health and well-being of children in need. Through this campaign, Chambers not only sets an example of corporate social responsibility but also inspires others in the industry to contribute to meaningful causes.",https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Real-Estate/Entar-1093345960714041/,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Other, Real Estate",1,Corey Chambers,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,

Despite best intentions, many communities find themselves unable to effectively digitize their utility, translating into continued operational inefficiencies, less visibility into asset health & system risks, and an inability to efficiently report key metrics to government, regulators, and ratepayers. Benefits are widely understood, and solutions, of course, exist; however, the way ‘digital water’ is being packaged and sold to smaller utilities is, in fact, the barrier to utility modernization.  The net result of stalled digitization is increased public health, safety, and environmental risks. WaterClick recognized that the way to accelerate utility modernization is NOT to lecture utilities about the benefits of digitization, rather, offer them a digital solution that meets their unique budget and operational needs.  We operate a platform that streamlines the onboarding of digital tools, offers pre-configured integrations, and delivers a cloud-based dashboard and support desk, all via a subscription model.  At the core of this ‘Platform as a Service’ (PaaS) business model is WaterClick’s proprietary ‘Click-in’ integration, which allows smaller utility operators to benefit from recent innovations in sensing, analytics, and decision support software that the larger utilities are already using; however, with WaterClick operators can simply add/remove features that meet their needs and budget.

Once the brand started to gain momentum, Kemper moved its board production to a snowboard factory in Montreal, Canada for the 1988/89 snowboarding season. In 1989/90 the snowboard production moved to Austria.  Kemper Snowboards quickly became one of the biggest snowboarding brands in snowboard history and competed directly against Burton Snowboards, Sims Snowboards, and Barfoot Snowboards. The Kemper snowboarding brand was best remembered for fully embracing snowboarding’s neon period in both their snowboard graphics and their incredible range of funky outerwear. In 1989 business was booming and Kemper had one of the best professional snowboard teams of the era. David Kemper eventually partnered with a windsurfing distribution company in Glendale, California called the Romney Group who added Kemper Snowboards to their portfolio of snowboarding brands. During that time, David relocated to California to help oversee the business, team management, and the growing product line. In 1992, David sold his remaining shares of the company to focus on his college education.  By 1994 the company was sold to an in-line skate company on the east coast. A couple of years shortly after, Kemper Snowboards officially went out of business. In the winter of 2018, Jib Hunt, a former professional snowboarder, relaunched the Kemper Snowboards brand. In the summer of 2019, Hunt moved Kemper’s headquarters from the east coast to Park City, Utah to better position the snowboarding brand for growth and exposure within the Utah snowboarding scene. Kemper Snowboards produces freestyle snowboards, park snowboards, powder snowboards, splitboards, and snowboards packages. The original Kemper professional snowboard team consisted of Mike Basich, Tina Basich, Dave Dowd, Martin Gallant, Kurt Heine, Andy Hetzel, Brett Johnson, Adam Merriman, George Pappas, Nick Perata, J.D. Platt, Tom, Burt, Rich Varga, and Jay Quintin (Smokin' Jay).",https://www.facebook.com/Kempersnowboard,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Manufacturing, Other, Sports",1,Jib Hunt,1-10,1,,2021-01-05,,,,Equity Crowdfunding,,,,Equity Crowdfunding,,USD,,,USD,,Ty Accornero,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.04%,11,,,,,,,,,,
