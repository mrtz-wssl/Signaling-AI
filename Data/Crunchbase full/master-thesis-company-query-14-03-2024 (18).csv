In 2020, Josh Pyatt and Jamie Horowitz presented Manning with a compelling pitch to start a media company. Initially hesitant, Manning recognized the potential in their proposal: the ability to run a media company from his Denver home, with the freedom to explore diverse subjects beyond football. Thus, Omaha Productions was born. Within just two and a half years, Omaha Productions has become a media powerhouse. The company produces several shows for ESPN, including the popular ""Peyton's Places"" and the highly acclaimed ""Manningcast"" - an alternate broadcast of Monday Night Football where Manning engages in real-time discussions with his brother Eli and various guests, including Barack Obama and Tom Brady. Omaha Productions also works on projects for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, in addition to earning substantial revenue from commercials for clients such as Bush's Beans, Caesars Entertainment, and Nationwide. Omaha's growing portfolio of content has attracted attention from media investors, who recognize the potential of the company. Seeking a partner to enhance his storytelling ambitions, Manning teamed up with media investor Peter Chernin, known for his early investments in successful ventures like Hello Sunshine, Barstool Sports, and Crunchyroll. Chernin's expertise and guidance will contribute to Omaha's goal of creating inspiring and inclusive content for diverse viewers. As Omaha Productions continues to flourish, Manning relinquishes his role as the quarterback on the field to become the offensive coordinator of his expanding media empire. With a sharp focus and a commitment to quality, Manning has transitioned seamlessly into the world of media, successfully establishing Omaha Productions as a prominent player in the industry.",https://www.facebook.com/OmahaProductions/,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",2,"Jamie Horowitz, Peyton Manning",11-50,1,,2023-05-17,,,,Corporate Round,,,,Corporate Round,,USD,,,USD,,The North Road Company,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.29%,3,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, they offer revenue share for every user, and low fees compared to marketplaces.  Example Use Case for core functionality: Imagine a freelancer, Alice, who agrees to a design project with a company, XYZ Corp. They use Midcontract to create a contract with specific milestones. Upon contract initiation, XYZ Corp deposits the agreed amount into an escrow account. As Alice completes each milestone, the smart contract on the Aptos network verifies the completion and releases the corresponding payment from escrow to Alice. This process ensures that Alice is paid on time for her work and XYZ Corp is assured of receiving the agreed-upon services, with all transactions securely recorded on the blockchain. How It Works in Practice: Contract Creation: Users create a digital contract outlining terms, milestones, and payment details. Escrow Service: Funds are securely held in an escrow account until contractual conditions are met. Payments: Upon milestone completion, payments become available to be released from escrow to the freelancer. Dispute Resolution: In case of disputes, the platform offers mechanisms for resolution based on the contract terms. I n essence, Midcontract makes remote work transactions transparent, efficient, and secure, leveraging blockchain's capabilities to provide an unmatched service in the freelance and service delivery markets.",,"East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Financial Services,,,11-50,1,Seed,2023-07-01,200000,USD,200000,Pre-Seed,200000,USD,200000,Pre-Seed,200000,USD,200000,200000,USD,200000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

We support students in grades Pre K through 12 with in home and online, private tutoring services. Our top tier instructors pinpoint academic strengths and weaknesses and create personalized educational plans for students. Specializing in assessment testing, educational consulting and career development, we don't just help students study for a test. Jump Start Tutors nurture students with holistic learning practices, enabling them to achieve their dreams. Our flagship SAT Program currently boasts an average increase of over 180 points, saving local families hundreds of thousands of dollars on college tuition costs. As the cost of college has increased over 20% in the last ten years, the average graduate owes $32,700 before starting their first job. Although SAT prep is key to college entrance and scholarship funding, the average cost for private tutoring is between $45- $125 per hour.

The last thing you should bet on in this situation is an unproven team that you don’t trust. GSD Venture Studios travels the world inviting resilient teams to establish partnerships that ensure organizations grow the right way, without games or gimmicks. Unlike traditional investors, we take senior operational (often co-founder) roles in these companies, capitalizing on our trusted reputation, experiences and network to drive explosive growth. We Travel The World Investing In Resilient Teams Bold Enough To #GoGlobal For companies to leave a lasting impact they must grow quickly, be bold and go global. In order to do so,  companies must engineer five things simultaneously: Product, Investment, Influence, Sales/Marketing, and Systems. Benchmarks for future funding rounds must be developed through all five lines of effort. We rarely find companies that are effective at all five, mainly because each line requires a tremendous amount of back office expertise and support. This is why we have partnered with top law firms, banks, coworking spaces, HR professionals and strategists to ensure your success. How We Get Shit Done For organizations seeking digital transformation or looking to increase their startup engagement, GSD Venture Studios is developing a collision point with key organizations and officials across the world.

Then, with a business analytic layer, matching data is run through algorithms to make recommendations both efficiently and timely.  The team has spent 10 years on the ground manually matching health system and insurance data directly with patients to make prudent recommendations around better quality and lower-cost healthcare. For the first time, due to interoperability and patient access regulations, we are compiling methodologies that draw on both parts of the system to make for a better patient experience.  // MILESTONES 2018 - Started R&D and Customer Discovery 2020 - Met with Health and Human Services (CMS/CCIIO Innovation Day) about interoperability/patient access 2021 - Participated in Ben Franklin Techcelerator 2021 - Participated in Pennsylvania Insurance Department Keystone Quickstart Program 2021 - Received Ben Franklin Grant 2022 - Filed as B-Corp 2022 - Rolling out MVP later this year //PLATFORM FOCUSES Cover - Before the cost of healthcare can be driven down, the needs of 160 million consumers who don't have access to employer coverage must have an objective source to get care. SnapHealth algorithms use health history, active medication lists, and income reporting to screen for prudent solutions and allow them to enroll right within the system. Compare - Between Health Equity, Rural Health needs, and Seniors with Caregivers trying to manage aging in place, SnapHealth will provide independent guidance on the most efficient methods to navigate healthcare. A patient must consider health networks, medical vendors, medication manufacturers, and programs available from their insurance, hospital, and government. SnapHealth will help sift through these programs and give patients access to tools ranging from Case Manager offers to Social Determinants of Health Programs. This is crucial when more seniors are aging in place. Response - As an untethered platform, the patient decides who and what can use their data. With deidentified records, we are looking to aggregate data in ways that would improve outcomes between the Opioid Crisis, Pandemic Response, AI interpretation of clinician natural language, and Clinical trials by using macro-level datasets. Outcomes - Feeds from NIH and other resources within trade groups and trusted health systems will advise patients on preventative care recommendations and outstanding screenings that are shown to be missing from the patient data on the platform. Circle - governance policies allow extended family, immediate family, and caregivers different levels of access and/or notices per your specific direction. Patients decide who knows what, and when.

(the “CAR INC”) is a FinTech company driven to plug the gaps in the crypto market and bridge the governance institutions with the existing and new thought leaders of the crypto industry.The crypto industry holds invaluable opportunities towards exponential economic growth through financial inclusion and participation of the masses. A new world is being born out of the reinvention of the financial systems built on unprecedented technological advances. And the Company is already in play to reap the benefits for its investors. As complex as the Company’s products and expertise are, the business model is simple, sustainable and highly profitable. All offered services are for profit—subscription-based models but are customized to each product line. This hedges the Company’s risk and also allows for identification of the most profitable revenue model, with the flexibility of replicating it. The Company has the experts and has developed unparalleled crypto market solutions. Now, the Company is rapidly acquiring customers. With a comprehensive Go-To-Market plan and an exhaustive Marketing strategy already in play, the Company has leveraged its technical expertise towards data analyses and automation to allow its subject experts to continuously innovate them using machine learning algorithms. The Company already has exciting products in the pipeline: Crypto Index, Crypto Sovereign and ETF Rating platforms, and more. In parallel, it also has a geographic expansion strategy in place—furthering financial inclusion. The Company’s leadership is made of technology and finance leaders with a combined experience of 200+ years—in entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. And the Company’s team is first and foremost passionate about Blockchain technology and its applications. We are the only ones in the industry with such holistic product offerings built on total compliance. It is exciting to bring our solutions and structure to this nascent industry and are confident that it will soon be shaping governmental and institutional policies. The Company is destined to be a change leader and wants you to join this exhilarating journey. We have developed solutions to resolve the four key challenges of the crypto industry: 1. Minimal Regulatory Oversight: Crypto Asset Rating Platform (CARP), an Independent Structured Rating Agency, comprehensively rate crypto assets for Institutional and Retail Clients. The Company developed custom rating algorithm to conduct an exhaustive multi-layered evaluation across 125 parameters from 15 categories and appraisal against four distinct risk buckets—business, financial, legal and technology. 2. Illiquid Asset Market: Tokenization Asset Platform (TAP) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) tokenization platform that offers the process of creating, issuing, managing and converting an asset to digital securities programmatically on Blockchain in a more restrictive and compliant way by embedding the logic in Smart Contracts. TAP also allows an issuer to create securities under various jurisdictions in a compliant way with a lock period, define vesting schedules, configure transfer and selling restrictions for inside and outside the exchange in accordance with regulatory rules, investor whitelisting, perform KYC and AML checks, digital securities recovery process, provide dividend distribution of tokens and conduct a voting event for shareholders. 3. Trusted Community Deficit: The Company’s quality content knowledge platform, Crypto Business World (CBW), is the one-stop-shop for all updates in the crypto market. It integrates in-house and external content to deliver subject matter across all platforms—news and articles, videos and podcasts, analysis reports and press releases. Additionally, it incentivizes industry experts to publish verified content on CBW through its ‘Content Marketplace’ feature. Thus, a trusted community (External Analyst-EA) is being developed. The Company developed a custom profile and consensus algorithm to nurture the trusted community. 4. Lack of Knowledge: The Crypto Training Platform (CTP) aims at leveraging experts and specialists from all of the Company's products, and their knowledge, to deliver Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and learning platforms and partnerships.

Specificity: They can be specific for a cell type. Scalable and low-cost production. High levels of cellular internalization. Nanotransfer delivery systems have a chemical affinity for the phosphate backbone, common to all nucleic acids, so the integration of the gene with the delivery system is independent of its sequence. We can decouple the synthesis of the delivery system and that of the geneof interest, which will allow a greater number of therapies to be developed with a positive impact on people´s health. Our non-viral delivery systems are unique not only because they are non-toxic and non-immunogenic but also becasue of their composition and surface properties.

They soon realized that this type of traumatic bleeding, which XSTAT has been proven successful in treating, is highly analogous to postpartum hemorrhage. Inspired to address this global issue in women’s health, the team quickly got to work adapting the combat medicine technology for an obstetric application. RevMedx partnered with a team from Oregon Health & Science University, who received a Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge grant to conduct early-stage research and development. This work culminated in a pre-clinical proof-of-concept study.  With the inception of Obstetrx, Inc, a pilot clinical trial was performed in Zambia in 2019.
