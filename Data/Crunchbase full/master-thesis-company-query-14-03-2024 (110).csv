Insurance We carry two million dollars in liability insurance covering breakage or any other damage that may occur in your home. (Firms using contractors often claim to be insured, but they may only be insuring themselves and not the actual contractors who are supposed to carry their own insurance. Very often, the contractors are uninsured.) We provide workers compensation insurance for our employees, so if they are injured on the job, they are well taken care of.
