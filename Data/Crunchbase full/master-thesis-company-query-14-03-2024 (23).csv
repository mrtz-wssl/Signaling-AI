We help municipalities enforce texting and driving violations with the goal of lowering the death and injury rates caused by incidents.   Our platform provides an iOS and Android mobile application to users (public and local government) which they use to submit videos of distracted drivers. This will aid cities in reducing the amount of cell phone use while driving and improve community, driver, and pedestrian safety. Our company works closely with local law enforcement and county traffic courts and we provide them with everything needed to efficiently issue tickets and enforce them.   Our primary business focus is increasing road safety by ONLY allowing and accepting videos to be submitted by passengers and pedestrians. Our app’s technology automatically tracks the user’s location, time, date, route and other necessary information needed to issue and enforce tickets. Once the user records the violation (a video clip of the violation and the violator's license plate) it is encrypted and sent securely to our servers where it is digitally signed to prevent tampering. Videos are reviewed and the ticket can be issued once approved by local law enforcement.   In summary, Government App Solutions is the first application and technology platform of its kind. We are the only provider of such a product and we are committed to reducing the prevalence of distracted driving. Since launch, local governments have asked us to expand our services to include vertical industries such as parking and code enforcement. We have been endorsed by State Representatives/Legislators, Mayors, Law Enforcement Agencies and even government agencies throughout the nation.

As a CPA from a large accounting firm, I was brought in to learn the car business from the accounting side. I was an A/P clerk, biller, office manager, controller and CFO. As a controller I was paired up with a GM to run the day to day operations of an auto mall with four franchises. Later as a CFO, the vice president and I ran the day to day operations of nine franchises in Chicago. During these seventeen years, I became involved in buy/sells, advertising, HR, bank relations, factory relations, legal, contracts and selling processes. During this time I would educate and train all department heads on the financial statement and forecasting. Due to the retirement of the dealer, I became the vice-president/GM of a single point Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram store. I was involved with the entire process of opening a new store. From getting factory approval, naming the store, website design and hiring all personnel. The dealer lived 1500 miles from store so I was the operator. While the VP, I learned the used car business by attending auctions and buying and selling vehicles, displaying vehicles on the lot and setting up a photo studio on the premise for high quality pictures. Additionally I spent most mornings on the service drive to improve service writer performance and customer satisfaction. Lastly I implemented a menu system in F&I that improved the dollars per unit by $250 and started a BDC. After about five years as the VP, I took on the largest challenge of my professional career. I moved across country to Las Vegas and became the GM of Towbin Dodge. During my first full year, 2013, I took them to the number one Dodge volume store in the country. The first time Towbin Dodge has accomplished that feat. Additionally in the same year, Towbin Dodge won the Walter P. Chrysler award only given to the top 25 CJDR dealers annually. Not only does it require sales volume, you also need market share, great service department and very high CSI.
