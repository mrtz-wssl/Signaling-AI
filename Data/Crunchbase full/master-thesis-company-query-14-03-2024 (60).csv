RaiseMeFunds,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/raisemefunds,2020-06-02,day,"Internet, Software","St Louis, Missouri, United States",Personal fundraising platform like GoFundMe for the unserved West-African region.,"850,308",,Active,,,,,For Profit,http://raisemefunds.com/,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/raisemefunds/about/,"RaiseMeFunds is a crowdfunding platform that allows members of the community to raise funds for events ranging from celebrations and graduations to life tragedy in French-speaking African countries.    Overview of Business   RaiseMeFunds empowers individuals to raise capital in a secure and affordable channel for all in this part of the world.   Problem   People in need in French West African countries have used social media platforms to ask for help for tragedies relief for the most part but donors in Africa and abroad are reluctant to donate due to unsafe/unfamiliar donations channels available.   Solution  Our Crowdfunding Platform will be the solution to the problem by providing a safe and customer-driven platform to allow people in French West African countries to donate money through a secure and accessible platform.   Product   RaiseMeFunds will allow Africans in the diaspora and back home to donate money for personal campaigns and to organizations.   Customers & Feedback   According to customer discovery we have done, Africans in the diaspora and back home will tend to donate money through campaigns if the channel is secure and affordable. So, we’re targeting the West African community abroad and donors abroad to provide access to a safe product for them.   Market   In 2019, the global Crowdfunding market size was USD 13.930 billion, and it is expected to reach USD 39.79 billion by the end of 2026. African volumes in a variety of crowdfunding models reached $182 million in 2016, growing 118% from $83 million in 2015. From a regional perspective, 41% of these volumes have been recorded in West Africa, 28% have been recorded in Southern Africa, 24% in Eastern Africa, and the remaining 7% in North and Central Africa. We picked Ivory Coast to install our headquarters because Ivory Coast is number five in the fastest growing economies in the world with an annual remittance ranging from $340-$390 million dollars.   Business Model   RaiseMeFunds is a crowdfunding platform that simply allows anyone to raise money for social causes. Campaigns can be launched in various categories, ranging from emergencies to medical; Individuals, as well as teams and charities, are eligible to open campaigns on the platform RaiseMeFunds shall make money by charging users a fee for every donation they receive. These are called platform and transaction fees. The platform furthermore generates money from donations that users can make directly towards the platform.   Competition   Currently, Donate-ng is the only crowdfunding platform in sub-Saharan Africa focused on personal crowdfunding which is only implemented in Nigeria. We are going to have our offices in Côte d'Ivoire.    Value creation   Unlike the Donate-ng platform, we will be based in French-Speaking countries starting with Ivory Coast, and eventually move to Senegal, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, where they are no existing crowdfunding now. Recently, a Nigerian based startup (PayStack), the only Nigerian payment processing company in Nigeria was acquired by the American giant payment processing company (Stripe) for $200 million. Just an example of how startups in Africa are progressing exponentially.  In addition, developing our personal secure payment processing system allows us to cut costs towards platforms like Stripe.  Sales and Marketing   Partnerships with telecommunications companies like (Orange, MTN) to facilitate our network and marketing strategy in Ivory Coast. We plan to work with local newspapers and social media experts to bring awareness to our platform. Currently, we are not able to predict any sales.  Investment Needed   In year one, we will need $10,500 for a server and maintenance, $20,000 for legal protection/Registration, $50,000 for an office, marketing, and HR.   Team   Jean Richard Loubao Kraka: CEO & Co-founder. Originally from Ivory Coast and Co-founded Innovative Apollo media, he is bringing his experience to RaiseMeFunds.

Ovis’s tokenized publishing model allows members of the community to curate and validate content by voting on story selection, fact accuracy and editorial objectivity. Members purchase Truth Tokens (TRUTH) and use them to vote on which stories to cover and on the accuracy of the content. The higher-ranking stories are rewarded. The TRUTH Token also has the power to hold the people of Ovis accountable to themselves and to each other, which is the exact opposite way mainstream media operates now.

Four barriers to entry artificially restrict the recreational boat market: Safety. In 2020, 767 people were killed and 3,191 were injured while on a recreational boat. That’s 2x more per-outing than skydiving. Hassle. The hassle of boating is often far greater than the hours on the water—prompting timeless quotes like, “The best boat is a friend’s boat”. Expertise. Lack of knowledge combined with fear of specific tasks (like docking and undocking) hinders adoption. Expense. Current operating costs include $400 per day in fuel plus unplanned maintenance, annual winterizing and de-winterizing, and marina-related expenses. We are starting from scratch and rethinking the way modern software, sensors, and control systems can (and should) change things to make boating easier, safer, and more accessible for all.

We're not only building a better, more engaging fitness app where you can challenge your friends, compete in contests, and support charities with your activity. We're setting out to fix the broken app economy, and we've built the model and the infrastructure to build a movement across an entire ecosystem.   For us, this started by recognizing that it's the users that give apps their value.  Not the app's features.  Not their code.  The users.  Without users, an app is worthless.   Many apps offer their app to users for free in exchange for the right to advertise to those users.  So users get a free and convenient product.  But they give up control over their data, and all the value generated goes to the app company and the app company’s shareholders.  Those shareholders enjoy a significant multiple on user-derived metrics like monthly active users and revenue per thousand ads served to users.  So app companies work hard to maximize users' time and attention so they can acquire more data and serve more ads.  Users become the products, and are often subjected to psychological manipulation and other exploitation by app companies.  All in service to increasing value for shareholders.   Users can vote with their feet, but usually there's no better alternative and quite often there's no alternative at all.  So the preferences of users - manipulated in any event as they are - have little bearing on this system.   If users are a necessary condition for value, but users are exploited and have little to no control over the system that defines that value, then the system is overdue for a realignment.   So we asked ourselves some questions.  What if advertisers had to pay users to advertise to them?   What if apps were co-owned by their user communities?   What if users controlled their data and privacy?     What would that ecosystem have to look like?   What types of organizations are needed?   What do the relationships between them look like? And why shouldn’t the whole system prioritize our planet and a social purpose? If we were to build a single app to address these questions we’d bet it would not only be viable but could also inspire others to build new models and change existing ones.  And that would be a small success.  But a platform; a whole ecosystem of apps, united in a common commitment and shared principles just might be able to deliver lasting, systemic change.   Fit for All is a benefits company, committed to people, planet, and purpose, with ESG built into its DNA.  Run2Play is the fitness app created by Fit for All that will catalyze the ecosystem.   We created the AVA Foundation to generate and manage a token that can be used across an ecosystem of apps.  An adaptive reward engine allocates AVA Coin to users in proportion to their eligible activity.  AVA Coin can be used to purchase in-app advertising space, used for in-app and sponsor purchases, and traded among users and on exchanges, providing value and utility to the coin.  Each user selects up to three charitable causes to support, with the Climate Crisis preselected for all users, who donate 30-100% of their AVA Coin rewards, making seamless charitable giving a foundational element of the ecosystem.   While each component of the system is essential and complementary, the most innovative and important is the For All Cooperative.  Formed in Colorado, the For All Cooperative is a multi-stakeholder cooperative composed of users, app companies, the AVA Foundation, and investors, each in four distinct classes of membership, with the investor class limited in equity and voting power.  The app company membership agreement requires app companies to transfer increments of equity to the Cooperative proportional to Cooperative users acquired, up to 15%.  The app company membership agreement also obligates them to accept AVA Coin for advertising placements, in-app purchases, subscriptions, and other services proportionate to AVA Coin rewarded for user activity in their apps, also up to 15%, after which it is burned.  The Cooperative’s backend, Core, enables a single sign-on for all Circle Apps and an ad module that provides advertisers with anonymized but granular ad targeting for users who opt-in.  The Coopertive’s app, Conduit, provides social and gamification components to user-members, enables voting on Cooperative initiatives, as well as a marketplace for Circle Apps.",https://www.facebook.com/gamingfitness,"Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Gaming, Lending and Investments, Payments, Software, Sports",1,Joseph Fargnoli,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,13,,,,,,,

Won’t listing my Meriden Connecticut property mean that it will sit on the market for months? Not to mention paying realtor fees, even repairs. The point of selling my Meriden house was to get cash (not spend it on repairs) and get rid of the hassle, not adding more. Appears to be counterproductive …”. Indeed we hear this often. Well imagine receiving a no-obligation cash offer on your house in Meriden CT, just 24 hours after you fill in the form. Then picture yourself, if you will, cashing a check of the amount agreed on just 10 days later. Suddenly, no more wondering what the tenants are doing. Or wondering how you are going to put funds aside to fix that leaky roof. You are done. Free and clear with the cash previously agreed upon.
