Did you know that millions of people around the world have made the token economy part of their everyday life? These under and un-banked people are eager to work, and accept payments in cryptocurrency through the CoinClaim platform.  Through its partners, CoinClaim serves this global workforce, and the individuals and brands looking to hire them. CoinClaim was launched in 2018 to provide a turnkey, fraud-free, single point of entry platform for individuals, brands and the world’s under and un-banked communities.  Our technology allows distribution of payments for services to recipients on a mass scale, with lower fees. CoinClaim is not a whitepaper. It is a proven, working platform serving hundreds of thousands of users worldwide. CoinClaim has not raised money through an ICO or IEO.  CoinClaim is a cryptocurrency technology platform that was built to solve three problems related to dispersing micropayments to individuals around the world.  ·        Payers new to cryptocurrency are subject to a fragmented and confusing technology experience when seeking to make crypto payments. CoinClaim removes the barriers to entry for those wishing to send micropayments. Our one-to-many system allows for input of any currency (including fiat), and output in cryptocurrency to an unlimited number of recipients. ·        Making payments to billions of under-banked and unbanked people around the world presents many risks. Sending fiat currency presents risk for theft or mismanagement of funds by those who distribute to the final recipient. Cryptocurrency is recorded in an open ledger, eliminating the potential for fraud. Crypto also allows direct delivery to an unlimited number of intended payees without middle-men or handling fees/charges. The intended recipient receives exactly the amount sent, without risk of fraud or middlemen “taking a cut” for their services. ·        Making micropayments with fiat currency or Bitcoin currently subjects the payer/payee to fees that are out of proportion to the low amount of the transfer. For example, an employer  may require 100 users to complete a task, paying $0.15 per task. The fees applied to each $0.15 payment would exceed the amount earned. With CoinClaim, $0.15 tasks can be distributed for a fee of 0.13% or less.  The CLM Token is an ERC-20 token created in 2018 and is currently exchangeable on three exchanges. All CoinClaim partners use the CLM utility token for transactions in the system.",https://www.facebook.com/coinclm/,"Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",2,"Bogdan Pavel, Jeff Ownby",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,

Paying via debit at the PoS in CO, CA, and other more developed industries exists, however, these systems operate as disguised ATMs, and incur many different fees as a result. This leads to a markup of >$10-15 in most cases. Rhizomatiq is a DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Utility Token based on the DAG-Tangle architecture; this allows for high efficiency, resistance to attacks, environmentally green operations and most importantly an incredibly high throughput rate for instant transaction authorization. Built on top of the DLT is a suite of Supply Chain Track/Trace algorithms that provide transparency up the Cannabis Supply Chain for Regulators, Consumers, Suppliers, and Merchants alike. This suite is a logistics tracing mechanism, that follows batches of tested Cannabis products throughout the distribution process; from seed, to sale. Rhizomatiq aims to streamline this process, and act as a base for the Cannabis industry to build on. Due to the efficiency and scalability of the DAG-Tangle architecture, we are able to offer extraordinarily low fees (.25% S2M / $1 C2M per Tx), and instantly approved transactions. The process is simple and intuitive. SEND / RECEIVE transaction pairs represent completed ""seeds"". These seeds are stored on ""nodes"", our word for the Account Tangle architecture. Transactions on the node are verified using a standard Random Selection algorithm. Before either a SEND or RECEIVE transaction is sent, a dense regulatory compliance process is completed in which the Account Holder's ability to partake in the transaction is verified. Rhizomatiq Tokens are Utility Tokens, therefore transactions are initiated as payment transfers to and from the senders and receivers payment methods, respectfully, and the Tokens themselves will never be able to be Bought or Sold.",,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Other, Transportation",1,Samuel Troyer,1-10,1,Seed,2022-03-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
