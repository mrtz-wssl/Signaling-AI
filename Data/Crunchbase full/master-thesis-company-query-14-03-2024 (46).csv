Creators on Poemusart upload their poems, music, and art, then use our editor to digitally combine all three to create a new medium we call ""Poemusart"".   This new combination a moving image, spoken poem and background music is a lot more entertaining. Creators on Poemusart can speak or write their poems in their own unique style on various topics, from current affairs to comedy, from short stories to inspirational messages. All are translatable into 21 spoken languages at the click of a button.   Most people would not usually read a poem or scroll through art, but when poems, music, and art are combined, this new combination becomes a lot more entertaining. Creators on poemusart.com can speak or write their poems in their own unique style on various topics, from current affairs to comedy, from short stories to inspirational messages. All are translatable into 21 spoken languages at the click of a button. Users of poemusart.com are categorized as viewers, creators, and advertisers.   Viewers can stream the algorithm-curated Poemusarts as entertainment and discuss it in the comments section. And advertisers display their brands on the website. Advertisers and users are also able to commission creators to create content for them in exchange for tokens. Viewers can also purchase a subscription. Subscription benefits include: creation of a playlist; skipping advertisements; use of the Text to Poem AI; and use of the Text to Art AI. On poemusart.com, ""NFT"" (non-fungible token) means that we endeavor to make sure that each poem, music, and art uploaded is not a duplicate of one that already exists on the site. It is not blockchain. It is very easy to use for everyone.   We also make sure that each combination of poem, music, and art that constitutes a Poemusart is a one-of-a-kind combination. The primary purpose of the site is entertainment, similar to video streaming sites like TikTok.com. A Poemusart is like a video in that, when played, the viewer sees moving digital art and hears a spoken poem with music playing in the background. Creators and composers that contribute to the site are able to monetize their Poemusarts by receiving gifts in the form of tokens or through ownership transfers in exchange for tokens. The tokens on poemusart.com are similar to the tokens on Tiktok.com or the coins on Reddit.com; they are not crypto currency and only serve to lubricate gifts and exchanges on the site. The ownership transfer of a Poemusart is not the same as transactions on NFT platforms. Poemusarts cannot be downloaded from the site. There is no risk of your collection being stolen from the site.   Also, on other social media sites like TikTok.com, there are many duplicates of the same videos or concepts. Users copy each other's content because they seek the benefits of having that particular video on their page. On poemusart.com, since we take strides to ensure that each Poemusart cannot be duplicated, the only way users can acquire other coveted Poemusarts is by transferring ownership in exchange for tokens. Benefits of ownership include increased traffic to the owner's collection, more attention, more discussions, more donations, and possible ad revenue sharing.   Like the text-to-poem and text-to-art A.I. functions, the text-to-music A.I. function will allow users to simply type in certain keywords such as genre, styles, tempos, and moods into the text box, and the A.I. will generate a piece of music from that prompt.",https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089935660568,Midwestern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Advertising, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact, Video",1,Raymond Attah,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,

The end-to-end software includes the following features: purchase orders management, inventory management, warehouse management, sales channel management, order management, and business intelligence. In addition to this, our software has the unique capability of processing customer returns. Returns management is the process of taking returned/distressed inventory and recapturing its lost value. Through data-driven metrics, our system is capable of helping you make the best decision to maximize recovery. In addition to this, it allows resellers to store their inventory in a variety of conditions (i.e. new, used, refurbished, open box). Our goal is to help resellers make smarter decisions when processing customer returns. The key objective is working to improve productivity in the reseller’s operations and warehouses. Our system will provide a step-by-step guide of where to begin once a return enters their warehouse. When a customer returns an item, there is a loss of profit that must be taken into account to maintain a high standard of customer satisfaction. However, our program will be beneficial to many resellers by recapturing some of that lost value. In addition to this, resellers can adjust the software to their unique business needs. They will be able to modify the software in a way that best suits their business such as how they want to process returns, ship out orders, and select specific sales channels they want to be present on. Lastly, we believe in creating a new norm that values social responsibility and sustainability.

But today’s customer engagement platforms are outdated, and overly complicated and don’t give brands the capabilities they need to solve this problem.",https://www.facebook.com/SnapyrOfficial,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Brian O'Neill,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,
