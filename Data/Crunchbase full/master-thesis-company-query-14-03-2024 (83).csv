The founder's company, SAS Games, has developed the successful series of TiViTz math/strategy games and tournaments that have already motivated hundreds of thousands of students to master their math skills. TiViTz was recently named a Microsoft Education Partner of the Year and has won multiple awards from Dr. Toy to Creative Child to National Parenting to Parents' Choice. To reach millions more kids, SAS Games has spun off a new venture called TiViTz eSports to develop an online youth eSports club with games, competitions, activities, avatars, currency and prizes to address the lack of math skills in our youth and to offer a less expensive alternative to math tutoring. Due to the shift of kids' ""heroes"" from traditional sports teams to eSports players, TiViTz eSports has partnered with Team SoloMid (one of the most successful eSports teams in the world) for eSports-related prizes and for membership promotions of the TiViTz Dollar Math Club...where kids (ages 9-15) will compete in eSports-style TiViTz competitions (PvP, Battle Royale, Team Leagues). TiViTz eSports is currently in partnership discussions with several other eSports teams, including those in the NBA 2K, Rocket League and League of Legends. Unfortunately, most parents cannot afford the $40+ per hour for a math tutor. But fortunately, they can afford a $1 per week membership for a youth-driven TiViTz Dollar Math Club. By taking the approach of ""kids helping kids speak math"", TiViTz eSports will help address the looming STEM crisis...3M US STEM jobs unfilled by 2020 and 420M unfilled globally by 2030.  Bottom line: TiViTz eSports will harness the power of eSports to motivate kids to “speak math,” so they can pursue STEM careers, fill our Information Age jobs and shape the future...how many jobs can you think of that don’t involve ANY math?",,"East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Education,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,

The foundation was founded in 2022 by Jennifer Stanich Banmiller and is headquartered in the SF Bay Area. Our goal is to help the women and their children/families who have been left as collateral damage to big profits by the drug and product companies by helping raise money for care, treatment and ideally building prototype Life centers in different parts of the country for them to physically get treatment at a physical or mental or wellness level.  History For 30 years, the drug and product industry has run amok over everyday citizens who trust the drugs they are taking and the products put in there body. But the trust is NOT reciprocated because big pharma/product companies will do whatever they need to to make billions, even if it means making injured or killing the most vulnerable of our society -women and children-who never complain and are traditionally silent victims. Litigation rarely helps them and there is no other avenue.[2] In 2019- Jennifer Stanich Banmiller and Alicia Mundy wrote the book- Crystal mesh.- How Addiction to money turned drug makers ,the FDA and doctors into street dealers to help women who had been brutally injured by a piece of plastic mesh put inside them without ever being tested in one live women feel vindicated, tell the story and hopefully get these women help and a voice. For women it was the most barbaric product ever to be mass sold and implanted in them. For doctors and lawyers it was a huge pay day. The atrocities of this and other products like Opiods and vaping have left countless women and their children/families dead, permanently disabled or just existing in great pain with no help for them medically or psychologically. That’s why the Jennifer Stanich Banmiller.org was formed. As CEO of Wingtip Communications Inc and Hive80 LLC she has been on the forefront of watching the most vulnerable of our society get unfair treatment and seeing friends, colleagues, strangers hope for help that will never come- not from health care, not from congress, not from the guilty parties themselves because they pillage peoples lives and move on to another big money maker. The Jennifer Stanich Banmiller movement will help create a network of physicians and health professionals who they can talk to and find referrals, medical help and or monetary help as money gets raised to lead a more productive life. Our goal is also to build physical Life centers for these women and there children/families where they can go free of charge to get the help they need to led a more healthy life whether that be sleep, counseling, treatment, meditation, whatever they need to be a productive part of society again and live again as much as possible.",https://www.facebook.com/Jennifer-Stanich-Banmiller-Foundation-108935581701955,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health Care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,

They spend tons of time applying for positions they will never be hired for. The reason is that the majority of companies don't consider foreign candidates. But there is no way to know it in advance. To help job seekers multiple their chances to be hired abroad, we created a database of companies that accept workers from foreign countries, sponsor their visas, and provide support in obtaining work visas and permits. All the candidate needs is to pay for a subscription that grants full access to the list of 10 thousand companies and a hundred thousand open positions in 40 countries, including the USA and Canada, the UK, Sweden, Norway, and others. Each of them is hand-picked and verified by our team. We regularly update our records and remove closed positions. We also help subscribers increase their chances of getting a job by guiding them in how to build a resume and prepare for an interview. We return money in case the visa rejection. We launched the MVP five months ago, targeting job seekers from Eastern Europe, and met a great demand. We got about 60,000 visits and reached a 10% signeup to paid subscriber conversion rate. Our next stage is launching the service in India, where about 18 million people search for jobs abroad yearly, and most speak English. We're planning to launch the English version of the product this year. We also see a lot of potential in Bangladesh, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, and other markets. Years of the pandemic revealed the acute need for foreign human resources in developed economies. Many industries suffer from a shortage of workers, and companies are happy to accept foreign employees. In the USA, for example, there were 10 million unfilled jobs in 2021, and only 8.4 million workers were looking for new opportunities. This not going to change for the better. The developed economies will need more and more workers from abroad, and the candidates from developing countries will continue to look for a better life there. We are a team of 6 professionals with experience in web development, database building, marketing, design and project management. We are seeking 450,000 euros for 10% of our company. The money will allow us to launch in India and get to other markets faster.
