It carries out prophylactics and diagnostics such as Saliva capture, Plaque and Tartar removal, DNA testing, etc. Our kit is LMIC-friendly thanks to its very low cost, tiny size, durability (5 years!) and being Water-conscious. With the help of DayOne, WHO and NGOs, we envision being able to touch the lives of 1.000.000+ billion children in impoverished communities around the world. Since Nano, our 'delivery' toothbrush can be sterilized in boiled water, it can cost-effectively be used in hospitals, clinics and advanced Posts to 'One-Offs' brushing   kid's teeth or even capture Saliva for the early diagnosis of diseases (e.g. Diabetes). Klevr, our high-absorption sterile gauze can be used to collect up to 2 ml of fluids from the mucosa. Then, with a simple twist, the user drops the Klevr inside the glass Vial to be quickly stabilized. Did you know? Left unattended, Gingivitis may evolve to Periodontitis and trigger several health conditions such as Diabetes, Cardiovascular & Kidney mal-function, Hypertension, pregnancy complications, Dementia, to mention just a few.   Did you know? Research indicates that SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM among poor children has DENTAL PAIN as one of its reasons.  It all starts with a thin layer of PLAQUE or BIOFILM that builds up on top of the Teeth's Enamel and then solidifies thanks to minerals present in our Saliva, and becoming Tartar.  Next, Tartar will provide 'food and shelter' for bacteria colonies that produce acids which in turn, perforate the Enamel, Dentin, etc...causing Cavities. Here's an intriguing fact: all the best toothpastes and toothbrushes sold in the USA were not capable of preventing that 47% of the US population have Gingivitis (it's endemic, according to the CDC).  Last but not least, our patent-pending USPTO application reveals a unique set of longer bristles dedicated to the hard-to-reach rear-end molars. Talk to us!

As a graduate student, I created my own website It was an excellent website, but visitors were low I started by going to an SEO forum and asking questions, answering questions, and reading various posts to keep on top of Twitter, facebook, and Reddit. My interest was piqued quickly. The course taught me how to create fantastic content and promote it so people would link to it and use it. This website receives thousands of visitors every day. My website's search presence was also improved. I was pursuing my college studies in 2011. Every day, I spent 18 hours on Blogging sites, Reddit, Quora, and SEO forums. As blogging and digital journalism were topics that few people seemed to understand, I became interested in them.  I read everything about blogging, SEO, digital journalism, or Google ranking. My comfort level with giving advice grew over time. Soon after, I was requested to look through their websites. I made a report to look through a site's metrics and give my thoughts on which factors were most likely affecting it. My inbox was full of help requests. Then I started writing for Quora, Reddit, and Offline. Soon, I was in high demand among my friends. For the most part, I was able to pass on this work to others.  My experience includes working with a wide variety of website creators. Working with newbies and small blogs is what I enjoy the most. I have enjoyed working with them. Today, I write, blog, do digital journalism, create content, review, and advise. I love it so much! check out our editorial guidelines by clicking here What is my highest Education qualification?
