You can finally concentrate on getting work done, with less stress. And then once you are done? We have all of those social and promotional pings waiting for you.  – WHY CHOOSE HARDLY?  –  Hardly recognizes that people are dynamic and needs change. One day, you may need some notifications and not want others. The next day, your needs may be the exact opposite. Distracting notifications aren't limited to shopping websites or social media. Sometimes, distractions can come from another client or a coworker. Our app allows you to easily adapt and hone in on your needs for that day, without fear of missing anything important.  — Need to mute a specific client's pings across 6 different apps for one day? One-click.  — Need to prioritize everything on one project but mute the others? One or two clicks.  — Want to mute everything except your mom? Cool. We'll let in your mom's social pings, her emails, her texts and hold everything else. ""BACK UP, WHY DO I CARE?"" 23 mins are lost for every distraction and that adds up to 5 weeks a year— poof! But turning off all notifications is a luxury for bosses and independent workers (aka, not a realistic option for most). Alert fatigue has been a frequently discussed issue in the healthcare and emergency worker industry, but no one has addressed alert fatigue for collaborative desk workers.

Operating silently in the background, we have been protecting you for over a decade from darknet cybercrime and terrorist attacks worldwide. Collectively we have over 100 years’ experience throughout the cybersecurity industry, providing the highest grade of cybersecurity used by law enforcement, military, government intelligence agencies and numerous Fortune 500 companies. Our founders recognized the legal cannabis industry and ancillary businesses’ need to be compliant in their cybersecurity programs as well as proactively protect their customers and investment. Although the Great Green Rush has brought many an entrepreneur and investor alike to establish their position during this infancy period, securing digital assets are often an afterthought. We have curated a full-suite of cybersecurity products for cannabis organizations and/or ancillary business to exceed local regulatory compliance standards and push forward to a national and global level. Typical cybersecurity offerings require a large initial investment, multiple security software applications, additional hardware as well as staff to maintain. This initial large expenditure is often why business owners forego cybersecurity compliance and training, however, we can protect your entire organization starting under $500/month.",https://www.facebook.com/420cyber,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Hardware, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,
