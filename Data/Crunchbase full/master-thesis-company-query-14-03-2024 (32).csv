There was no one stop shop for everyone’s Cannabis needs.  The goal of Cannabist is to make EVERYTHING Cannabis related available, easy to acquire and purchase. This goes far beyond just your typical head shop items like, portable vaporizers, pipes, rolling papers, grinders, etc. Cannabist want to offer EVERYTHING! We want to offer, ALL CBD and Hemp products, including but not limited to, beauty products, cosmetics, hygiene products, sports supplements and drinks even Hemp clothing and jewelry. We even want to get into the kitchen and cooking departments by offering all sorts of different kinds of kitchen appliances that will help people cook and bake their own homemade edibles. To take that even further we want to have an entire hydroponics and grow yourself section of the website where we supply all the products, tools and step-by-step guides on how to grow your own Cannabis plants.  With all of that being said we also recognize the fact that Cannabis needs to be consumed safely and stored securely. That is why we have an entire section of our site dedicated to discrete child-proof storage containers of varying sizes. Just like how alcohol is in hard to open bottles or is locked away in a liquor cabinet, we want to provide the same security and peace of mind for our customers’ when storing their Cannabis.  The end game is to create a place where shopping for Cannabis products becomes more normalized. We want our customers to feel just as comfortable ordering Cannabis related products from our site as they are ordering products from Amazon. By creating an online retailer like Amazon to cater to these specific needs we are pushing the needle further ahead to pave the way for new businesses and brands to enter the market and to integrate Cannabis use into society even more.  In order to stay competitive with other online cannabis retailers and even conventional online retailers, we at Cannabist are constantly updating our product lists and adding new product categories. We want to cater our shopping experience as much to the consumer as possible. But it is not enough to keep our customers satisfied, we need our brands to be satisfied as well. By giving no brand any special treatment we allow smaller brands to compete and sell their products at similar rates to those larger and more established brands. There is plenty of market share to go around to include everyone. We are just as much champions of the little guys as we are for the big guys as well. Not only we do we keep our brands happy, but this allows us to offer a wider variety of products that you will not be able to get at other stores. Therefore increasing the competition between brands which results in the best possible price for you the consumer! By creating an environment where big brands have to compete with smaller brands it keeps prices at a palatable value. We know that many cannabis products can be very expensive; especially CBD products. But with this methodology we will be able to guarantee the lowest possible prices across all our brands.

This process is also unsafe when you don't have access to clean water to wash the cup. When CapdCup is full, you simply open the cap on the bottom of the cup, which allows its contents to empty. Then, close the cap, and you’re on with your day in a matter of seconds - no removal necessary. CapdCup is a new sustainable period solution designed for modern lifestyles—CapdCup eliminates the pain and time associated with having to remove, empty, and reinsert your cup repeatedly throughout the day.
