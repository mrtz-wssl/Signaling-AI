Arstat's products have proven efficacy and safety and focus on major areas of unmet medical needs in women's health: contraception for overweight and obese women, uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and painful and heavy menstrual periods. Arstat's high-value portfolio is protected by 10 granted U.S. patents (more pending) and a European (EPO) patent.    The pipeline includes 4 drug candidates with proven efficacy and safety. Two products are Phase III-ready (confirmed by the FDA), two other products are ready for Phase IIb. An addressable US market is approximately 50 million women with projected peak US net sales of $3.0 – 4.0 billion. The targeted global market may exceed 800 million women with significant European and worldwide sales.    Arstat's most valuable asset, Nuvocept, is the first and only oral contraceptive designed explicitly for overweight and obese women. The FDA has already endorsed an unprecedented clinical program and a potentially unique label. Nuvocept is expected to dominate a multi-billion-dollar segment of the U.S. contraceptive market  The Founder and CEO of Arstat Pharmaceuticals, Arkady Rubin, has over 30 years of industry experience (J&J, Pfizer) and is the co-inventor of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, the best-selling oral contraceptive in the U.S. with peak sales exceeding $500 million per year. Arstat is raising a seed financing round to hire key executives, assemble a top-notch Board of Directors ahead of a $50.0 million public offering one year later, potentially in conjunction with a strategic partnership or collaboration. Proceeds raised in the public offering would allow Arstat to advance its Phase III candidates through NDA filing, FDA approval, and sale or out-licensing in 3 - 3.5 years from the initial financing round as well as complete Phase IIb studies for its remaining candidates. Conservative estimates of the fair value of Arstat's product portfolio at the time of the public offering are between $500 – $800 million.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Arkady Rubin,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2023-10-03,,,,4,,,,15,0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,,,,

You have clearly defined the problem you're addressing and your unique approach to solving it. However, your introduction could be further strengthened by including a few additional details. Here's a refined version: “**Interactive Support for Intelligent Realization of Ideas using AI ** At [isiri.ai](http://isiri.ai/), we are committed to democratizing the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technologies. Our core mission revolves around creating an accessible and interactive platform that enables users from various domains to take advantage of the potent capabilities of GPT technologies, irrespective of their technical prowess. We have identified a key challenge – the complexity of developing effective GPT prompts – which acts as a deterrent for many potential users. To overcome this obstacle, our platform focuses on two main aspects: simplification and collaboration. We simplify the process of creating GPT prompts, making it user-friendly and intuitive. We also foster collaboration between users and prompt developers, encouraging continuous feedback and iterative refinement. This unique combination allows us to ensure the final products are perfectly tailored to the needs of the users. As part of our services, we offer dedicated support to translate industry-specific expertise into practical AI applications. This allows us to facilitate the creation of high-quality, user-oriented GPT tools, contributing to our broader goal of enhancing the reach and impact of AI. Our ultimate aim at [isiri.ai](http://isiri.ai/) is to break down the barriers that prevent individuals and organizations from harnessing the transformative power of GPT technologies. We envision a world where advanced AI tools are not just limited to tech-savvy users, but can be leveraged by everyone to fuel innovation and growth."" For advancing and completing your project, here are some key recommendations: 1. **Customer Feedback:** Constantly solicit user feedback. This will ensure your platform is continuously improving and aligning with the needs of your target audience. 2. **User Interface:** Prioritize the development of a user-friendly interface. The ease of use will be a key factor in attracting and retaining users who aren't tech-savvy. 3. **Partnerships:** Partner with organizations or individuals who are domain experts. Their knowledge can help to build effective GPT prompts and they can serve as evangelists for your platform. 4. **Security and Privacy:** As you'll be handling user data, invest heavily in security infrastructure. Ensuring data privacy will build trust with your users. 5. **Marketing and Education:** Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that also includes educating potential users about the benefits and possibilities of GPT technologies. This can help drive adoption. 6. **Scale Up:** Initially, you can focus on a niche market to test and refine your offerings. Once you're confident about the product-market fit, you can plan to scale up. 7. **Funding:** Depending on your financial situation, you might need to raise capital to support the development and scaling of your platform. Consider approaching venture capitalists who have a history of investing in AI technology startups. These are just some ideas that could help you in refining your startup and making it more attractive to both users and potential investors.",,"Washington DC Metro Area, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Information Technology,1,steve yeo,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,

At Agora Brands Group an avatar is technology that looks like a person, moves like a person, speaks with you, listens to you, sees what you are doing, understands what you are saying and offers help and advice within a customer service setting.  Agora Brands Group is The Face of AI. Most avatars applied to business applications today are “pitch” avatars while the avatars being developed by Agora Brands Group strive to deliver a higher level of interaction.  These avatar designs deploy AI-driven technologies of facial and speech recognition along with the latest developments in the language technologies of Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Processing. Global economies have shifted and continue to shift from manufacturing-centric to service-centric.  In the growing service economy there is rising demand for well-trained, educated, engaging and personable front-line staff.  These employees work in customer service positions as well as service and support roles in the food services, retail, eldercare, healthcare, travel and hospitality sectors.  To fill these critical front-line positions, companies increasingly are turning to digital solutions to address a shortage of qualified staff.  Chatbots, automated voicemail systems and call center facilities fail to fill this gap with any degree of quality or success.
