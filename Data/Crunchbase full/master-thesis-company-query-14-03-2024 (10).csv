By developing solid-state production methods to improve electrodes, the company produces batteries using less energy, materials, and equipment. Intecells is breaking manufacturing out of its decades-long stasis toward a future full of new products and capabilities. Founded in 2018, Intecells invented solid-state printing techniques leveraging cold plasma to fundamentally change the way electrodes are shaped and built into flexible cell formats. The company is revolutionizing what is possible not only for manufacturing and environmental impact but also for consumer product creation for years to come. Partnering with leading battery makers, OEMs, and academic institutions, Intecells plans to bring its innovations from lab to production in 2022. The startup is the brainchild of Dr. Shawn Gayden, a Chinese American inventor, and business executive, who led battery manufacturing research for more than a decade, and Christian Buske, a German entrepreneur whose company first commercialized cold plasma technology decades ago. Intecells’ technologies eliminate binders and solvents for a cleaner electrode-making process, thereby opening new paths for a wide range of cell chemistries and applications across sectors at low production costs.     This game-changing endeavor is a rising tide that lifts everyone in the value chain. For materials and equipment suppliers, collaborating with Intecells adds value to products; for cell manufacturers, applying Intecells’ technology means they can write the rules for future battery production; and for OEMs, Intecells innovations eliminate many traditional and costly design constraints.  By adapting proven cold plasma technology to solve new problems, Intecells’ technology allows the battery to follow product form, not the other way around. The company’s new technology shrinks battery size, with limitless possibilities for shape, while retaining the same power output for less money. In the short term, Intecells is working to demonstrate its flexible batteries that offer personalization for a new wave of consumer products.  The company’s long-term goal is to revolutionize the electric vehicle battery industry and accelerate renewable energy storage. Today, the company creates bespoke technology for customers seeking to improve manufacturing processes and economic outcomes.",,"Greater Detroit Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Manufacturing",2,"Christian Buske, Xiaohong Gayden",1-10,1,Seed,2019-07-16,1999999,USD,1999999,Seed,1999999,USD,1999999,Seed,1999999,USD,1999999,1999999,USD,1999999,Walden International,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,

The Challenge: Early lung cancer is asymptomatic. By the time it is seen on chest scans it has been in the body for years and often spreads to other organs making it very difficult to stop. If detected early, lung cancer can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy with a very high success rate. Today only 14% of lung cancers are caught early, and 84% of patients are late-detected after they experience symptoms and seek medical attention. Our Solution: Hawkeye’s LEAP (Lung Enzyme Activity Profile) diagnostic blood test quickly pre-screens the millions of people at risk for lung cancer to select the subset requiring full screening workups. This optimizes hospital resources, lowers healthcare costs, and reduces patient anxiety for greater peace of mind. LEAP can be repeated yearly as part of a regular health check-up. Our Technology: Hawkeye has developed a nanoscale protease biosensor to detect enzymatic misregulations in 18 biomarkers associated with lung cancer. When nanosensors built into the LEAP test come into contact with blood from a patient with lung cancer (any stage, any sub-type) they are detectable by Hawkeye’s machine-learning software algorithm.

SIDIS Health modules allow organizations to rapidly grow revenue-generating locations and services while significantly reducing the related operational costs and increasing cash flow velocity on claims. The organization shifts from supporting all services manually using software to monitoring the software for exceptions and targeting resources at those areas until the AI learns how to continue automated handling of those exceptions. Care quality is able to be tracked at the metadata level by fully integrating each organization's unique curriculum and treatment plans into Sidis Health, vastly increasing transparency into treatment progress and the ability to continue receiving re-authorizations from insurance payers and utilizing the data collected to negotiate better rates and eventually help establish value-based reimbursements within Autism & ABA therapies. Treatment plan progress for patients is tracked by AI to compare similar patient profiles and identify variables that indicate specific patients are progressing better or faster than others and can identify where case managers should pay the most attention and the AI could even suggest alternative options to consider for more effective outcomes. Sidis Health enables direct care providers and case managers to focus on the detailed data driving their treatment decisions while allowing support staff to focus on their standardized workflows to support revenue generation.

We lead the field of intelligence-centric platform with a distributed learning paradigm shift such as federated learning and create an intelligence-centric platform led by world-class research scientists and engineers. Today, cloud-based AI and big data systems face significant challenges but aren’t equipped to meet them head-on. Data privacy has emerged as a global concern, but AI systems utilizing big data simply can’t preserve privacy while learning. Similarly, in a world where IoT and device data outpace the speed of bandwidth growth, latency in AI data processing is causing avoidable bottlenecks.  TieSet has developed STADLE, a Scalable Traceable Adaptive Distributed Learning platform with a core feature of decentralized federated learning that preserves privacy while collecting and maximizing intelligence to be shared. Because intelligence is created and trained locally on edge devices to be gathered by STADLE, our platform generates high-quality intelligence without uploading data, enabling AI systems to operate and perform at scale while offline. Our message is simple. Collect, maximize and share the intelligence around the world. That is the world TieSet envisions for the next generation of technologies, for which we call the Internet of Intelligence (IoI) where intelligence is the one that is mainly exchanged over the Internet, not just raw private data. That said, AI is now transitioning from the product of big data to collective and continuous Intelligence, and can finally be productized in a variety of areas of our lives including finance, robotics, healthcare, automotive, education, public infrastructure, transportation, smart cities and energies, among a lot more others.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"George Jeno, Kiyoshi Nakayama, Shigeki Nakayama",11-50,3,Seed,2021-01-01,420000,USD,420000,Pre-Seed,420000,USD,420000,Pre-Seed,668600,USD,668600,668600,USD,668600,"Newchip Accelerator, PCI Holdings, Grace Services LLC, Ultra Holdings",,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,1,2,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,
