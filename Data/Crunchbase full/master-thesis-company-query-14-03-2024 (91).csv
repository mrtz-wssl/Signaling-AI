A vast majority of men's testosterone boosters (and a wide swath of supplements for that matter) include a variety of ingredients that are either under-dosed or proven to be ineffective through research. By creating a supplement for the men's health market using tried and true data, we're breaking the industry mold and giving men something that will not only promote testosterone levels but overall health and well being. The big problem we're addressing is that men's testosterone levels are on a 40 year decline from environmental factors such as over-farming, improper nutrition from fast/junk food, estrogen mimicking chemicals in our food and water supplies, not to mention the everyday pollution from our daily environment and of course, stress. We've seen and understand the research that these testosterone deficiencies can be corrected through supplementation with the right vitamins, minerals, nutrients and ayurvedic herbs. Our formula is built to help men increase their testosterone levels to a maximized normal range, at the top of their body's natural capabilities. Testosterone isn't just for working out at the gym which is a common misconception. There are additional health, psychological & cognitive benefits of higher testosterone. One could argue that testosterone is the most important hormone for men's overall health and well-being.",https://www.facebook.com/androfuel/,"Greater Denver Area, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Food and Beverage, Health Care",1,Chris Walker,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
