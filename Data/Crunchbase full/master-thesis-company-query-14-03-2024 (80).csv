We are seeking a partner or investor to join with us to help move the R&D program into clinical phases of development. 2) Toxicology Screening Services: Another of our projects is the use of high-throughput in vitro biological assays in the area of developmental toxicology. Initial screens will involve the use of human umbilical cord- and placental- derived stem cells in vitro which may allow your company to decrease the use of animals and the costs incurred in developmental toxicology testing. 3) Oncology Drug Testing: We are also developing human in vitro 3-dimensional multicellular systems that mimic the tumor microenvironment that may be used in the pre-clinical phase of the development of drugs, biologics, and biosimilars. These 3-D tissue constructs, that contain multiple cell types that are found in the tumor microenvironment, therefore more closely represent the dynamic conditions that are exhibited in vivo in the tissues of human subjects than that which can be observed using 2-D tissue culture systems. 4) Please see our funding campaign at Gust.com or AngelList.com: https://gust.com/companies/superlative-biosciences-corporation/dashboard https://angel.co/company/superlative-biosciences-2 5) Superlative BioSciences Also Provides Consultation On: Biologics, Biosimilars, Pharmaceuticals, In Vitro Diagnotics, Cell & Tissue Therapy, Stem Cells, and Combination Devices Regulatory Guidance The Preparation of Quality Manuals & Other Quality Documents including Change Control, Deviations, CAPA, FMEA, Trending, and Complaint Handling, FDA/GLP, FDA/GTP, FDA/QSR, FDA/GMP, ICH, EMA, CE Marking & ISO Documents Management.
