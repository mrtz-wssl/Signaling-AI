Data on blockchain though is extremely noisy, hard to read and even harder to make sense of them. Openstory was created in order to organize and democratize the access of blockchain data so users can make educated decisions, based on information and knowledge that before was only available to highly technical funds and companies. What’s happening on-chain Openstory is not a siloed API aggregator, a hand-picked catalog, or a centralized recommendation web2 service. Openstory is an indexer that focuses on scanning and unveiling on-chain truth like a story so everyone can easily make decisions based on objective information. What you see in the platform is not a recommendation from an employee or the curated information of APIs; instead, our database starts and ends with indexing the public on-chain information, offering a pure outcome of how people use and interact with web3. How challenging is this? Mapping web3 is both a data intelligence challenge and a UX challenge. How do we display the information meaningfully and drive usage beyond? How deep do we go? Your feedback is essential to its success, so we'd love you to be part of this journey early on. How to use Openstory The initial token/NFT sale can be the beginning of the experience, not the end. A creator or a brand can use Openstory to see how web3 users use/interact with their creations, spot their audience (who is buying and what’s their engagement) and reward them accordingly. A collector can use Openstory to assess if an NFT is worth buying based on usage/investors attracted, discover the up-and-coming collections, meet other collectors/soulmates, and create deeper relationships with the artists they love. A flipper can discover the most recent collections that grow exponentially. Everyone can check key market metrics, e.g., active users in the market, market growth, and marketplaces with the highest traction, so they have a better picture of the market they invest their money and time.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Other, Software",4,"Katerina Stroponiati, Kostas Stroponiatis, Vinh Nguyen, Yiannis Varelas",1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Was Acquired,2023-12-04,day,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,

From lack of a clear value proposition, lack of an understanding of your product from a value-based approach, to not knowing what problems you’re trying to solve and how that relates to your prospect. The lack of asking your prospect good open-ended questions to find the gap, of what problems they face and how your product can help fill that gap, to unstructured onboarding and guidance, to the overwhelming amount of busy work that often doesn’t contribute to closing deals, we’ve seen sales reps, founders, and leaders struggle. At the same time, the tech industry is witnessing significant layoffs, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, and Zoom considerably reducing their workforces. This industry shift has caused a surge of talented tech professionals to venture into entrepreneurship, launch their own firms, or join smaller tech firms that present substantial growth opportunities. Moreover, we’re experiencing a groundbreaking era characterized by the emergence of Generative AI, heralding an exciting new wave of technology. This transformation in the tech landscape introduces compelling advancements and opportunities. In this dynamic context, we see a unique opportunity to assist these emergent ventures and tech firms grappling with articulating their unique value propositions. That’s where HyprWin comes into play. Our next-generation sales enablement platform, powered by advanced AI, is primed to meet the needs of this rapidly evolving landscape. It leverages this new wave of technology and taps into the immense pool of talent looking to make a mark. HyprWin’s primary objective is to optimize the sales process, from prospect identification to deal closure. We leverage AI technology to create a dynamic, swift, and focused workflow that guides you efficiently in the right direction. Our focus is not to replicate CRM systems, laden with unnecessary complexities where only a small fraction of the features are truly useful. We adopt a CRM-agnostic approach and offer API connectivity, allowing you to integrate our platform with your existing CRM solution seamlessly if you choose to do so. Our roots are in the realm of microservices and laser-focused sales processes. With HyprWin, we’ve streamlined the approach, enabling startups to efficiently market their unique value propositions and maintain that crucial focus to facilitate rapid sales. We stand as a resource for individual contributors and teams eager to accelerate their processes and articulate their value in the most effective manner possible. Here’s how HyprWin addresses the common challenges and can be particularly beneficial to startups and smaller tech firms in the current climate. Structured Onboarding: In the wake of tech layoffs expanding the talent pool, startups and smaller tech firms are ideally positioned to harness the skills of these high-caliber professionals. With HyprWin’s AI-Driven Workflow, we eliminate the prolonged and complex onboarding processes, allowing you to swiftly integrate these professionals into your sales process. Our platform serves as a comprehensive workflow, designed to guide anyone looking to sell their SaaS product from prospect to close. This means that new representatives, irrespective of their experience level, can hit the ground running with HyprWin, armed with the necessary insights and tools to excel. Guidance: Our platform provides continuous guidance throughout the sales cycle. From prospecting to closing deals, HyprWin’s AI guides reps every step of the way, ensuring they never feel lost or unsure of their next move, which is particularly crucial for startups that need to move quickly and efficiently. Eliminating Busy Work: With the rise of “revenge startups” by those affected by layoffs, there’s a need to focus on what matters most - building a quality product and closing deals. HyprWin automates various time-consuming tasks, freeing up sales reps to focus on these key aspects. From updating customer records to ranking lead quality, HyprWin handles the tedious tasks so your reps can focus on building relationships and closing sales. Reducing Non-Closing Activities: HyprWin streamlines the sales process by focusing on activities that directly contribute to deal closure. Our platform promotes clear communication and goal alignment with prospects, ensuring that reps spend their time on high-impact tasks that lead to sales. With HyprWin, sales reps are empowered to focus on what they do best: selling. Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with an intuitive user experience, revolutionizing the way sales teams operate and helping startups and teams to navigate the current landscape of the tech industry. With the ongoing economic disruption and the surge of startups, the current market conditions create an ideal environment for new businesses to emerge. A recent survey of 1,000 laid-off tech workers conducted by Clarify Capital LLC found that 63% of the respondents started their own company after their layoff. As these new startups rise from the ashes of tech industry layoffs, HyprWin stands ready to support these bold entrepreneurs and smaller techfirms in accelerating their sales and driving their success. In the end, we believe that the key to overcoming the challenges in the sales process lies in intelligent automation, actionable insights, and effective guidance. With HyprWin, we’re making that belief a reality, one sales team at a time. HyprWin is more than just a tool - it’s a game changer for those in the sales industry. Whether you’re an individual sales rep looking to streamline your process and sell value in the best way possible, or a startup aiming to sell your unique value proposition quickly and efficiently, HyprWin is designed to support you. We are committed to helping teams and startups navigate the changing landscape of the tech industry, turning challenges into opportunities and driving success. With HyprWin, you’re not just getting a platform - you’re getting a partner in success.

She has helped companies create and execute on business plans which have sold for a combined valuation of $1.6 billion. Reiss is also a lifelong athlete and supporter of competitive sports.  She founded PlayyON to address the challenges and inefficiencies faced by organizers, participants, and athletes in the sports and recreation industry. The Company PlayyON is in the sports management technology sector, providing a comprehensive software platform for event management, registrations, payments, communications, and community building. Used by around 9,000 organizations, PlayyON's focus is on streamlining the processes associated with organizing and participating in sports events and programs. PlayyON offers a unique social media-centric model built on Amazon Web Services that fosters community engagement beyond basic sports events and program management. PlayyON is a social media centric platform, like a LinkedIn or a Spotify which provides a vertical community and marketplace. The Problem  Organizers (managers, coaches, trainers, directors), typically use a hodgepodge of apps to connect, communicate, and make payments for various things. Managing multiple apps is time consuming for the organizer and it is often confusing and frustrating for participants. Whether it is a community organizer running a local event or a professional athlete engaging with his/her fans, too many apps leads to confusion and frustration.   The Solution PlayyON offers an affordable, instant access,  all-in-one app for sport and recreation organizers.This makes organizing and management easier for all involved.

VISION  'Chasing' the Wind vision is to bend curves, bridge divides, eradicate IT gates; fighting the corporatocratic climate that has placed more emphasis on sub-optimal optimization and bottom-line profitability than empowering employees and providing total customer satisfaction through continuous improvement and quality management principles. CORE VALUES  'Chasing' the Wind core values are forged in America's Founding Documents; especially the preamble to & Declaration of Independence; alongside earth's Wisdom Literature, to bring US once again— under God with Liberty and Justice for all. CORNERSTONES 'Chasing' the Wind is built on four cornerstones of sustainability :  1. Selfless development;  2. Bottoms-up strategic framework; 3. Total transparency, and  4. Unquestionable ethics  RECESSIONARY ISSUES The North American economy has seen an amazing decade of growth. The market recession was inevitable. While pandemic epidemics' could have been preventable. Employer Employee loyalty is no longer in existence.  Wealth gaps widen.  IT and digital skills gaps are getting ignored.  Systemic rot sits top-down.  While sustainability gets tossed around as a now trending keyword. And the elderly are getting abused by database con-artists, family members, and entitled neighbors.  with Wind works tirelessly at:  - Bending curves. - Closing gaps. - Bridging divides.  - Eradicating gates, and  - Fighting systemic issues driven by corruption, kickbacks, bureaucracy, and hypocrisy.

UnderContract.dev aims to  leverage the most immediately impactful (in-demand) real estate opportunity found in the southeastern US - rural Georgia and the suburban/urban areas of Greater Atlanta.  As a bootstrapped and disadvantaged entity in rural Georgia.  GREAT LEAP FORWARD Emerging technologies (AI, ML, NLP, Kubernetes, etc) continue to push the envelope. We either take this next great leap forward or further stagnate in the midst of pandemic, epidemic, overdose crisis, and machines learning real-time states of unconscious bias/learned trait hate.  - Realizing the great leap will widen the wealth gap and negatively affect the majority of US. Causing socioeconomic conditions for the disadvantaged and minority populations to create a circular paradox. RECOGNITION & AWARDS - Acknowledged as high up as the United Nations.

However, web3 is quickly gaining popularity and has the potential to revolutionize how we eat out. In the current landscape, restaurant owners create and market their NFT using **Opensea**, and then users have to find their NFT and create a wallet to collect these NFTs, which have no direct benefits. This is a problem, as we are currently seeing users lose interest in NFTs because they do not understand their value or how to use them effectively. [According to Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/restaurant-trends#:~:text=%236.-,Restaurants%20are%20rethinking%20experiences%20to%20build%20deep%20customer%20loyalty,-Restaurants%20are%20coming), **Restaurants are rethinking experiences to build deep customer loyalty and drive sales. This is especially important for restaurants trying to create a differentiated experience in their category, which is the majority of restaurants today. The goal is to create an experience that makes customers feel like they are part of something special and exclusive.  NFTs can provide this experience by giving customers access to experiences they can’t get anywhere else.** [**Starbucks recently announced that they are adopting web3 as a reward system**](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/starbucks-is-about-to-make-a-controversial-change-to-its-rewards-program-some-customers-are-going-to-love-it.html). This means that many non-crypto natives will be able to experiment with crypto assets without missing out on the most critical aspect of blockchain; decentralization and trustless systems. In addition, by providing users with the ability to use their NFTs as utilities, Starbucks would be able to generate more customer loyalty and engagement. This integration will also allow Starbucks to expand its reach into different markets where it previously had no presence. This will be the beginning of insight and metadata that NFTs will offer as a social currency to businesses.

Drawing inspiration from Indonesian desserts his mother made, Sam created the signature recipe of what is now every fan's favorite Mochi Muffins. To make it all happen, Wenter worked full-time while Sam spent all day baking. They then drove around delivering their pastries to the six wholesale coffee shops they had locked down contracts with–all without fail. Soon enough, their Mochi Muffins gained a huge following throughout the Bay Area for remaining relevant to today's culture and tastes while still holding a hint of nostalgia.
