Homeowners get paid upfront for the exclusive listing of their property and agents bid on listings they are confident they can sell. A win-win for all. Selling a home is the most important financial transaction most Americans will ever face, and BidMyListing® allows for better decision making and facilitates the best possible match between sellers and agents. BidMyListing® has designed a highly advanced technology marketplace where the homeowner finally has the power. The Problem Real estate agents wasted more than $20 billion last year in advertising and marketing in seller leads to hopefully secure a signed listing agreement with a homeowner. The Solution With BidMyListing®, real estate agents can shift their marketing and advertising budget from companies such as Zillow and purchase the listings from the homeowner through BidMyListing®’s marketplace.  The Result The homeowner receives cash upfront in their pocket and more importantly, a motivated real estate agent with skin in the game. The real estate agent is now able to buy guaranteed listings that they never would have known were available in locations they specialize in.  Founded in 2021 by Founder and Chairman Matt Proman and Co-Founders Josh and Matt Altman. Josh is one of the top agents in America responsible for selling more than $1.46 billion in real estate in 2021 alone.

For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020.  PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains.  -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball.""  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value.  -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our ""credit score for transparency."" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore.  ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development.  -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.    BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system, all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh, safe products at full margin.  CUSTOMER PROFILE Transparent Path technologies support food, pharmaceuticals, blood/plasma, transplant organs, and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods.  PARTNERSHIPS Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Duke University, and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market, and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore.  ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORS Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT.  FUNDRAISING To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, three grants, and four angel investors. In April 2023, the company was awarded grants totaling $440,000 from the National Science Foundation, ReFED, and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.   FOR MORE INFORMATION Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business.

On Avg. 500K Americans lose power daily without backup solutions and 84% of Americans are concerned. Existing grid vulnerability is exacerbated by energy transition volatility.

We do this through fractional ownership of rare sneakers. Say goodbye to waiting in long lines for hype drops, or fighting bots online to get your hands on those desirable shoes you can flip for a profit. Rares makes it easy. You buy shares in the shoe instead of buying the shoe.   Here is how it works:  LEARN:   You may already be savvy about sneaker culture and shoes, which is awesome. However, we feature shoes on our platform that have specific attributes and stories that make them valuable. We will educate you on these stories through our videos and other tools, so you can truly understand the value of what you are investing in.  Investing not your thing? Don't worry we got you! We explain all the necessary investing terms so you only have to focus on your knowledge of shoe culture to make a smart investment.   BUY:  We release our shoes on our app through Initial Public Offerings (IPO). That means we make fractional shares of the shoe available for the first time for you to buy. You can buy this and hold it until we sell the shoe and cash in on the potential profits, or you can trade them with other users on our app after the IPO closes.  TRADE:   Once the IPO closes, you can always sell your shares to other buyers who missed out on the initial drop! No need to hold on to your shares forever! What is even better is that the shares may be worth more after the drop and you can choose to take your profits. You could also hold on to the shares until we decide to sell the shoe and then you potentially profit off the increase in price. Missed out on the drop, you can also buy shares from someone looking to sell theirs. Either way, it is up to you. Our platform makes it easier than ever to match buyers and sellers.   ENGAGE:   Whether you are actively trading or not, we welcome you to come on our platform to engage in a community of like-minded users. You can follow other investors, like comment, and react to relevant posts around sneakers. We think it is important to not feel like you are the only one in the room on a trading platform and we know sneakers and community go hand in hand. So please hang out and stay a while! So what are you waiting for? Stop watching from the sidelines! Invest in the culture!

Dr Lipov, the Chief Medical Officer at Stella, is credited with innovating the Stellate Ganglion Block (""SGB"") as an intervention for trauma symptoms. After experiencing trauma, the way our brain functions may change in dramatic ways. In some cases, we become stuck in “fight or flight” mode - which can be observed in certain types of brain scans. It may be helpful to think about the sympathetic nervous system as being somewhat like an engine. Under normal conditions, we are in “neutral gear,” a relatively relaxed state not associated with feeling threatened. However, extreme stressors can shift and lock us into a higher gear, where we may remain for years or even decades. This state may involve “feeling constantly revved up and being unable to throttle down.” Common indicators of this altered biological state include symptoms like disrupted sleep, anger attacks, overwhelming panic, difficulties concentrating, a feeling of constantly being on “high alert”, and a strong startle response - in other words, the “hyper-arousal” cluster of post trauma symptoms. Stella’s adaptation of SGB involves injecting a widely available, commonly used anesthesia into a bundle of nerves in the neck, just above the collarbone. The injected medication has the short-term effect of soothing and “re-setting” the overactive nerves, operating in the same temporary way as the Novocaine administered by a dentist. To return to the earlier analogy, SGB seems to manually pop a “stuck gear” back into “neutral.”",https://www.facebook.com/StellaTraumaCare,"Greater Chicago Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health Care,3,"Eugene Lipov, Michael Gershenzon, Stefan Weitz",51-100,1,,2023-05-09,7000000,USD,7000000,Venture - Series Unknown,7000000,USD,7000000,Venture - Series Unknown,7000000,USD,7000000,7000000,USD,7000000,Sterling Partners,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,38.71%,69,,,,0,2,,Medical services; veterinary services,,,
