How can an attorney help to improve your life? It depends on what type of attorney you’re working with. If you’re not facing any criminal charges then you might think there’s nothing that an attorney can help you with. But this greatly underestimates what goes into estate planning and the more boring aspects of the legal system. Many people don’t want to consider planning their estate. It seems like a lot of work, it involves thinking too much about what happens when they’ve passed away, or they just don’t think that their estate is important enough to require any estate planning. But nearly every estate can benefit from some estate planning. Estate planning and estate administration are ongoing processes. Estates change and grow in a similar manner to the way that families do and so estate planning becomes estate administration and you’ll often need to re-examine your estate plan and so can be a lot of work to tackle alone. But how else will you start a trust, get your will in order, and decide who will be your power of attorney? The answer is by planning your estate. You can ensure that your family deals with as little probate court as possible by considering what goes into your will and how you can transfer assets and property by making clever use of trusts. If all of this sounds confusing, don’t worry… it is! But that’s why the services of Magiros Blattner are a must. Why try to tackle this confusing ground on your own? Why not work with an attorney that understands the law inside and out so that you can spend more time relaxing and less time trying to figure out how to plan your estate. Leave the hard work to your attorney so you can focus more on the things that matter in life like your family.",https://www.facebook.com/magirosblattner,"Greater Baltimore-Maryland Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the Café is a place for them to sit and eat while the work is being done to their vehicle, if it’s something we can’t fixed in the same day we also can provide a room for them to stay in for the night at the Motel that is also located on the property. When their vehicle is done, the station will have all the things they need to get back on the road ASAP. Our goal for this company is offer a one-stop Travel Center with everything that travelers need such as gas, fuel, cold/hot drinks, ice, cafe, mechanic shop. We have also planned to remodel the gas station/cafe and motel along I-35 1-mile North of Hwy 20 in Williams IA. The market we have is a huge opportunity, sell both diesel and gasoline, as well as food in the restaurant attached to the gas station/Shop. The store would provide snacks, candies, alcohol and tobacco products. Also, we would provide items for auto care such as diesel additives, oil, wiper blades, antifreeze, tires, etc.  We have mapped out strategies that will help us take advantage of the available market and grow to become a major force across Iowa and many other states to come. We are set to use many marketing and sales strategies such as:  - Digital Marketing  - SEO - Referral Incentive - Email and SMS Marketing  -Distribution of Fliers etc. As of right now, it is a small truck stop struggling to make ends meet and looking to sell.  I am a cashier/ maintenance man. I pretty much do everything here except balance the checkbook. There are many guests that love my ideas and would love to see me make my dreams a reality. I get told on a daily by customers that they would love to have the restaurant back up and running. I would love to fully get the restaurant open to state and federal standards. It has all the appliances to operate the kitchen. They are a little out of date but they got the job done when I cooked in the kitchen in 2015- 2017. The property needs some repairs to get it to 100% operation. The flat top roof that covers the station, café, shop leaks and needs replaced but 95% of the building is brick and mortar. I wasn’t to say that with a little TLC this Great idea would make many lives easier for travels. The goal here is to create a safe haven for truckers and travelers.

The capability of this product will allow anyone to clean a nearby water source quickly, efficiently and for long duration of time consisting of daily usage. Issues within the clean water industry range from lack of efficiency, cost, and adequate ways to provide people in need of these services and technology. The times of having to boil water, going through long tedious steps to filter water, or having to travel great distance with dirty water to go through the previously mentioned steps will be a thing of the past with this product. This, along with our mission to provide clean water to underdeveloped and underprivileged areas within developing and developed countries, is our driving force. Trinhydral believes that clean water shouldn’t clean out your wallet. We plan on making devices and leading in projects to make the perception of limitless useful water a reality for all. Trinhydral has planned income producing projects, like the Flint Project, to focus an alternative method for clean water besides the use of water bottles. The Trinhydral Filter will provide different variations, such as the Home Edition, Army Edition, Hiker Edition, and other interchangeable components. Each edition solves a common problem dealing with water; the Home Edition is for the household that cannot install a water filter at home, the Army Edition focuses on speed efficiency and uses electricity, and the Hiker Edition is more compact designed to fit inside a backpack, for easy travel and use. Trinhydral plans to capitalize on this opportunity by focusing on direct sells to nonprofit organizations/companies, charities, and government entities who are faced with this challenge and want to provide more than relief.

The agency recruiting model is often it’s own worst enemy.  Companies hire multiple agencies that work on a contingent basis to compete with each other in a “resume race” that rarely results in finding the best candidate.  It certainly doesn’t increase the workload of your internal staff.     DTT doesn’t play the contingency game.   We’ll leave that to the resume mills, recruiting bull pens, and national agencies that view you and your needs on a report, rather than as an internal trusted source.      When you want something new, something that transcends that way it’s always been, get in touch, and we’ll see if we are a good match for each other.",,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Professional Services",1,Jon Eborn,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,
