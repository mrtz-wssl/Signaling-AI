With its clinician-first approach, Maya’s home-to-office information exchange provides practical, accessible solutions for home healthcare agencies. Maya saves time and reduces costs and miscommunication for busy clinicians, increasing agency profitability. With a real-time accurate treatment environment, clinicians can focus on doing what matters most—providing quality care to their patients. The idea for Maya Healthcare began 10 years ago in an actual home healthcare office. Our founder noticed his facility’s nurses struggling to use outdated EMRs. Although there were several options on the market, most of them had the same user pain points, such as:  - Difficulty coordinating care and scheduling accurately. - Failure to provide a clear picture of patient health.  - A steep learning curve and lengthy user training process. - Redundancies in data entry that take up much of nurses’ time. - Unreliable mobile platforms. In order to simplify the record-keeping process and create solutions based on real problems, we work with top UX designers, an in-house programming team, and current home healthcare nurses. Through this process, we are able to address user pain points and tailor our product design for the best possible user experience. At this point, we have basic functionality and our first set of required forms complete. We are looking for an investor to help bring us to MVP.
