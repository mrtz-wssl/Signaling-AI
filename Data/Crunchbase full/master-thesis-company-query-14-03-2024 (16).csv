When you put on your VR headset and come to our virtual Zen dojo we make meditation as clear and structured as possible with our research backed curriculum. The fully immersive qualities of virtual reality allow us to bring our students to a separate space for meditation. No clutter still sitting in front of you on your desk or todo lists in your periphery - we remove the distractions of the outside world and engage you in a dedicated, peaceful, and realistic environment - without forcing you to leave your home or alter your schedule. VR also allows us to incorporate dynamic experiences to the classroom, such as teaching on a mountain top, or in a rainstorm, or with metaphorical tools like clouds floating by to represent thoughts. Things you could never achieve in real life! Unlike existing meditation phone apps,  we don’t just provide temporary relaxation; we teach with a focus on education, growth, and how to apply what you learn to your everyday life. Actual, practical, techniques, mindsets, and philosophies to use outside of virtual reality. We have a developed product launched on Oculus App Lab, Oculus Rift, and Steam VR marketplaces and initial traction with hundreds of paying customers in the first few months. We’re developing partnerships with key VR headset distributors and other wellness companies. And the Georgia Tech master’s thesis research backing ZenVR’s design has been accepted for publication at an industry defining conference this spring.
