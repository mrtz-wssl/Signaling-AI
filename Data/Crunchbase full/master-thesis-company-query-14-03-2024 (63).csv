Indigenous Chocolate Company,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dearuhua,2019-08-05,day,"Agriculture, Consumer Goods, Environmental Engineering, Farming, Food and Beverage, Food Processing, Forestry, Medical, Nutrition, Organic Food","Richmond, Kentucky, United States","Origin and source of ""Chocolate"" and ""Cacao"" which are common law international trademarks belonging to Indigenous Peoples.","938,754",,Active,,,,,Non-profit,https://www.dearuhua.com,https://twitter.com/dearuhua,https://linkedin.com/company/40938196,"De'Aruhuä (DEARUHUA), also known as ""INDIGENOUS CHOCOLATE"" is an original non-profit social enterprise benefitting the Indigenous Huottuja Foundation (Piaroa People) of Colombia and Venezuela. It is being developed by Globcal International (see profile) which permits crowdfunded equity and public ownership stakes of remote community based cooperative business assets, capital and real estate through sustainable investments in agroforestry, carbon offsetting, ecosystem services and forest monitoring projects in protected biodiversity regions. This project qualifies under all the current future policy scenarios as an ""ecologically sound investment"". Project investors are investing in planting cacao tree seedlings, forest monitoring of protected territories, a cacao post-harvest facility, a cacao research laboratory, and an indigenous operated chocolate factory. Planned investment is both non-taxable and medium-term (5 years-10 years+), ownership is in a US based LLC with a full cooperative stakeholder privileges (one member one vote) that limits investment at 0.5-10%, the maximum number of voting participants is based on the number of 1% or greater owners. The territory of the Piaroa People is larger than Belgium, it is over 33,000 square kilometers (7.2 million acres) and has the capacity to sequester over 130 million tons of atmospheric carbon per year, in 2019 the sovereign Huottuja people formed a government and is now sourcing all of their ecosystem services through their court and tribal council.  The ""Indigenous Chocolate"" Trademark Project seeks to break the foundation of Big Chocolate demanding a tribute for the use of the 'biocolonial' Theobroma cacao (L.) genome which has been proven to originate within the Amerindian territories of the Piaroa, Yekuana and the Yanomami on the Guiana Shield in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Venezuela. Although anthropologists and ethnobotanists have traced it to Ecuador, the regions of the Andes they identified did not exist geologically or geographically yet; Theobroma cacao was determined to be at least 10 million years old; wild Theobroma cacao found in nature can only be traced to the 1) Guiana Highlands and the 2) Eastern Andes of Peru and Ecuador; all other cacao in the world originates from these two regions and can be traced to these locations genetically by examining the DNA. Either way it is the intent of Globcal International to represent the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas to protect their Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP).          Our project calls for producing high-quality added value ceremonial, nutritional and medicinal couverture (indigenous chocolate bars) from natural wild-grown heirloom variety organic cacao. The proprietary methods, recipes and techniques are safe with the indigenous producers in our factory, the indigenous people are happy because they never saw anything like this before and the investors are happy they have exclusive rights over the international marketing and distribution of a product that is in high-demand among connoisseurs of fine chocolate from aromatic cacao connected to a particular region.   All of the harvest of wild cacao and production into chocolate will be managed by trained, competent and reliable indigenous women and young people from 13 villages who will be producing chocolate remotely on a property that is owned by Globcal International located 24 kilometers inside their territory at the end of the protected area easement established in the 1970s, the Huottuja Foundation and the Special Indigenous Jurisdiction encompasses an area the size of Belgium (30,000 square kilometers) of mostly unbroken hinterland forest. The investment period reopens September 01, 2022 through Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) Invitation to members of the Huottuja Foundation of $10,000 each which is equivalent to 1% of the company. The business plan has been written, 1% or greater investors can take an active role in the non-profit Indigenous Chocolate business, claim a distributorship in Australia, Europe, or North America, investors can be repaid in cocoa beans if they want, or be a silent investor to wait for the investment to mature.  The project will also be backed and funded in part through a Tax-Exempt Charitable Bond Issue being organized under Ecology Crossroads Cooperative Foundation (ECCF). The bond will be to provide critical infrastructure and training in the 13 communities that will make up the core group of cacao farmers, agroforesters and food processing employees (chocolate makers). The bond will guarantee and facilitate a sustainable indigenous economy and autonomous governance with new community centers, solar charging stations, street lighting, transportation and public bath houses. The $10,000 ECCF Huottuja De'Aruhuä Bond will cost $5,650.00 and mature on December 31, 2030. At that time, only bond investors can cash in the bond or remand the bond for its equivalent in cooperative shares held be Ecology Crossroads.

For grocery partners, Caboodle offers choice in what product combinations (known as “bundles”) they offer each week. This allows grocers to sell better space to distributors, manage inventory, and direct consumers to high-margin food options.
