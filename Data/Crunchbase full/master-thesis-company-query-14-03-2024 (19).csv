We're helping to bridge the gap between disparate health systems & their inability to streamline systematic communication of health data; to achieve better patient outcomes and increase human longevity.  How do we do this? Our solution’s ability to query patient information, significantly faster and much more accurate than any front-end API, will help physicians reduce the time spent looking at a computer screen.  We do the hard work on the back-end, so physicians can do the critical work on the front-end; providing a high efficacy driven & personalized care approach.   How do we do this? MedlyticsAi’s population health management platform leverages natural language processing , natural language understanding, machine learning, and other technological innovations; improving hospital workflow & enabling each physician to see, on average, 3 more patients per day/11.4hr work shift.  We do this by significantly reducing the time spent on EHR chart review, which also helps to reduce physician burnout.  The ability to transform existing health care data into the new standard (FHIR), will spark innovation and yield better patient outcomes.  Our technology is strategically built to implement and comply with the standards set forth by Health level 7,   FHIR v4.0.1, and the US Core Implementation Guide v3.1.0. We understand FHIR guidelines will continue to improve as we collectively journey on this endeavor.

Through this strategic partnership with SAFE, Mayo Clinic is committed to applying its accumulated knowledge, world-class clinical expertise, and general standard of excellence to empowering billions of patients worldwide with access to quality routine care. Core to realizing its mission is the Company’s Digital Health and Connected Diagnostics Platform that enables rapid implementation of specialized digital healthcare applications designed to improve access to affordable treatment of common medical conditions, efficient chronic disease management, and auditable remote patient monitoring (the “Platform”). Designed by the former Chief Architect of the CDC, the Platform combines virtualized provider services, AI-enabled care automation, electronic patient record interoperability, public health reporting, and remote point-of-care diagnostics to enable companies and world governments to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce delivery costs at population scale. Building on exclusive technology licenses from Columbia University, the Company has developed an integrated Connected Diagnostics System (“CDS”), which completes the connected care loop by enabling self-collection and real-time digital assessment of rapid diagnostic tests outside of the point of care, coupled with a proprietary system for enabling crowdsourced telehealth provider services at the speed and scale required for population-scale adoption. The CDS dramatically extends current telehealth capabilities and will enable a wide range of new remote patient care/monitoring applications.SAFE is currently implementing an IRB study in collaboration with Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University (“ASU”) designed with guidance from the FDA to secure EUA clearance for home (outside lab) use of multiple LFIA-platform COVID-19 rapid antigen and antibody tests.",,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Health Care, Information Technology",1,Ken Mayer,101-250,1,,2021-11-02,,,,Convertible Note,,,,,,,,,USD,,"Particular Ventures, Three Bridges Private Capital",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,2,3,,4,6,Testing,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

Our desktop app, a key innovation, captures players' performances in real-time, ensuring transparency, trust, and seamless payouts. These micro-tournaments provide an avenue for passionate gamers to participate multiple times a day, turning their skills into real profits. Problem Addressed: In the gaming community, players frequently face challenges when engaging in wagers or bets. The lack of a trusted mechanism to verify opponents' performances often results in payment disputes, impacting the overall gaming experience. GameWagrs steps in to provide a secure platform where contestants can confidently compete, assured that they will receive their winnings. And our Personal Parlay feature addresses the “burn-out” many gamers feel after hours of playing their favorite game, and only having a handful of “weapon skins” or worthless in-game currencies. Current Landscape: Traditional gaming wagers rely on trust, with players often resorting to external payment platforms like Venmo. Verifying opponents' performances requires watching live streams, creating a cumbersome process that disrupts the gaming flow. Our Solution: GameWagrs solves this problem by securing contestants' funds in an escrow account. Real-time game data from our desktop app/API determines the winner, and funds are automatically released to the victor. This innovative approach simplifies the wagering process, making it secure, transparent, and user-friendly. Behavioral Impact: Our platform transforms the behavior of gamers by offering a seamless and trustworthy environment for wagers. Users can engage confidently, knowing that payouts are guaranteed, enhancing their overall gaming experience. This shift in behavior not only fosters trust but also positions GameWagrs as the go-to platform for skill-based competitions. Revenue Model: We charge a nominal fee for each wager made on our platform, ensuring sustainable revenue while providing users with a fair and transparent gaming experience. This fee structure supports continuous platform improvements and innovations, enhancing the overall value for our users. Personal Parlay Feature: In addition to micro-tournaments, GameWagrs introduces the ""Personal Parlay"" feature, allowing users to challenge themselves to beat personal records. This unique offering caters to users seeking individual skill improvement while providing additional opportunities for wagering and profit. Market Opportunity: The esports and skill-based gaming market presents a significant opportunity, with GameWagrs uniquely positioned to tap into the growing demand for transparent and equitable gaming competitions. With a target Total Addressable Monthly Revenue (TAMR) of $1M over 24 months, GameWagrs aligns with the trends of gamers seeking skill-based engagement. User Engagement and Growth: GameWagrs anticipates increased user engagement as the platform expands its game offerings and forges strategic partnerships. With a strong presence on social media, partnerships with content creators, and a growing waitlist of eager users, GameWagrs is poised for a successful launch and sustained growth. Competitive Advantage: GameWagrs distinguishes itself by leveraging a desktop app for real-time data validation, eliminating the dependency on contestant livestreams. This not only ensures accessibility for a broader user base but also prevents classification as gambling, allowing for more extensive marketing and user acquisition efforts. Team: Led by Andrew Lea (CEO), Nico Deguzman (CMO), and Kevan Donley (COO), the GameWagrs team combines extensive experience in gaming, content creation, and business operations. Andrew's vision, Nico's esports expertise, and Kevan's engineering acumen drive the team toward creating a revolutionary gaming platform. Future States: GameWagrs envisions transformative outcomes, including a shift in market perception, industry recognition, increased engagement, market expansion, and a more diverse gaming ecosystem. As the platform gains momentum, GameWagrs is poised to become synonymous with transparent, skill-based gaming.",,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gaming, Internet Services, Software",1,Andrew Lea,1-10,1,Seed,2023-01-01,20000,USD,20000,Pre-Seed,20000,USD,20000,Pre-Seed,20000,USD,20000,20000,USD,20000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.84%,25,,,,,,,,,,
