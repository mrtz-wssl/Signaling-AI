With our unique approach of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks, KAPUA's customers enjoy MAPEs (mean absolute percentage error) and WMAPEs (weighted mean absolute percentage error) in the lower single digits. This increased accuracy allows organizations to lower working capital while improving fulfillment levels.   Related research in this field suggests a 3M profit increase on a 100M business driven by a 10-20% improvement of forecasting accuracy, and KAPUA set out to take this even further. In multiple cases, we're able to reduce a company's forecasting error to a 10th of what it was before. As AI is taking over a lot of the manual work, planners can now focus on developing new strategies to maximize revenue and minimize working capital.   Because AI is able to detect patterns in your internal and external data sets, our implementation approach becomes really low-touch and therefore extremely accelerated: we can set up a tenant in our public or private SaaS environment within a few weeks from start to finish.

Most of you use online reviews as part of your doctor selection process. Unfortunately, doctor reviews are scattered all over the internet, and visiting a few review platforms may not give you comprehensive information about their online reputation, resulting in a sub-optimal selection of your healthcare providers. We believe that everyone should have access to the comprehensive reputation scorecard of doctors so that they select the best healthcare providers available to them. ScoreDoc is a key tool for assisting patients in selecting the right healthcare provider. It is an easy-to-use, convenient information source that informs you about the quality of healthcare providers by analyzing online reviews on all major review platforms. Our reputation scorecard platform also employs artificial intelligence to provide medical groups or doctors online reputations, including analysis of sentiment expressed by patient reviews. If you are unsure which healthcare provider to select, enter the details of the physician or practice you are evaluating to generate their comprehensive reputation scorecard. The reputation scorecard will provide you with a percentile score to compare the prospective healthcare provider or practice with other providers in that specialty.",https://www.facebook.com/ScoreDocOfficial,Southern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Health Care, Information Technology",2,"Ajay Prasad, Minu Prasad",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.29%,2,,,,,,,,,,

Creary is a decentralized social network without censorship, where users can freely share their creations in an economic system managed by the community itself. Aimed at all artists, musicians, designers, writers and professionals in the audiovisual sector who produce digital content and use the Internet to sell or distribute their creations among their fans and followers.    As in any conventional social network or creative portfolios directory, in Creary users can post their work to share them with the rest of the community. As an innovative fact, in Creary, users will receive rewards for the interactions their content receives. The likes are not just likes anymore, so users should bet on the quality of what is published to get a good community of followers who vote for their works.    Creary offers a public and transparent alternative to intellectual property. The platform applies the power of attorney of the revolutionary Blockchain technology in the process of registering content to create incorruptible proof of existence (POE) that certify the authorship of any digital work.    Money is always a political issue. This is why we have designed an alternative cryptocurrency with the goal of promoting the economic empowerment of creative people against the traditional banking system.
