Legacy Strategies Without a personal legacy plan, the value of someone’s estate can be eroded by taxes, and the disposition of their assets may not be what they intended. Families need to be aware of this risk. They need a financial professional who can work with their attorney and tax professional in funding legacy strategies that can include life insurance products. Long-Term Care Insurance A plan to cover long-term care expenses is often overlooked but can be a key component of a solid financial foundation. Although the need for long-term care may be far into the future for many people, the time to plan for it is now – to help ensure expenses are covered if and when extended care is needed.

Family Offices, in ever increasing numbers, leverage their entrepreneurial DNA in the pursuit of direct investments. Offices struggle to review proposed investments due to a lack of trust, experience, staff, and/or time. The challenges, associated with the rise in direct investments, encourage a desire for co- investment with like-minded entities. A misalignment in values and horizons, alongside an environment of high fees, drives family offices from traditional investments in public equities and fund structures. High standards with regards to privacy, discretion, and security further limit potential strategic partners. We believe that the best long-term partner for family offices are other family offices. Uniquely capable of leveraging their significant shared expertise, capital, and influence, inter-family office partnerships provide an attractive alternative to traditional fund managers by operating with greater control and flexibility without facing limiting time horizons, high fees, and regulatory restrictions. The opportunity for cross-collaboration often presents itself beyond the traditional realm of capital allocation.",,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services",1,Michael Calvo Elhauge,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
