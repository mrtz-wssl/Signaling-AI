Creating Highways and Byways for the Digital and Autonomous World. Edge computing, 5G wireless, inspection drones, autonomous cars and trucks, air taxis, etc., all need to be part of, and to share, a common infrastructure. Local governments are struggling today with permitting disparate infrastructures that need to be a single open and intelligent infrastructure. The integration process is ready for a jump start. The country that does this well first will likely capture the preponderance of the economic benefit. Conceptually, the autonomy landscape is the cloud computing landscape writ large. The digital infrastructure at the edge needs intelligent system developers to have a market and the intelligent system developers are equally dependent on the digital infrastructure being deployed at the edge. The autonomy infrastructure permits “apps” like optimized traffic management, autonomous cars, or drones that respond to 911 calls, or autonomous delivery, or automated road and bridge inspection. The digital infrastructure these “apps” need is the public, open, locally controlled intelligent and autonomous infrastructure. The Public Infrastructure Network Nodes will support 5G wireless, Edge Computing, Radar, Sensors, Enhance GPS, and Intelligent Transportation Systems. The edge computing will convert real-time and stored data streams into information that can be used by the various apps.
