We provide powerful analytics to our global client base of LPs, GPs, data providers, and investor advisers. By combining in-depth industry experience with data science, quantitative, and fundamental investment analysis expertise our team enhances our customers' decision-making, investor relations, asset allocation, fund manager selection and business development. Our products and services cover different asset classes like private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, real estate, and infrastructure and enable clients to perform detailed analysis of their investments and make efficient decisions about their holdings.  With the growing allocation to private equity it is critical to reliably project PE cash flows and value. However, this is challenging due to the structure and illiquidity of the asset class, the scarcity of public information, and the high degree of uncertainty about the size and timing of the related cash flows. Moreover, the shift in global trends that led to an increasing importance placed on fair value requires a fundamental change in the valuation approaches to private equity. However, fair value is based on judgement and thus often leads to biases and to minimize this problem, valuation must be performed by independent professionals using industry best practices. We offer proprietary models for forecasting and valuation of PE cash flows, price, and risk.  Our cash flow model BOSTON (Bow-Speed Time-Option Normalized) offers a robust approach that addresses the needs of the vast majority of PE investors and incorporates volatility to give a more informed performance picture, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of investment cash flows.  Main features:  1. Founded on sound economic principles and broad empirical support. 2. Combines the intuition of the Yale model with our own research insights resulting in a robust approach that addresses the vast majority of investors in private equity partnerships.    3. Incorporates the volatility of the underlying investments using best-of-breed third party risk models to give a more informed investment performance picture, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of investment cash flows.   4. Provides LPs with a measure of the magnitude of potential cash flow shortage in relation to their future liabilities (redemptions, pension outlays, capital expenditure, future unfunded commitments, etc.)    5. Allows GPs to predict the amount and variation of future distributions  to optimize the capital call schedules and deal flow, as well as plan the capital resources of their firm in the most efficient way over time.  6. A key component of our risk-aware valuation model EXPLO. Our valuation model EXPLO (Expected Profit Loss) allows LPs  to monitor their investments, screen new opportunities, and develop/adjust their portfolio strategies. Main features:  1. Independent valuation, not derived from GP appraisals.  2. Available at each point in time and thus suitable as a comparable methodology for bench-marking across periods and funds.  3. Compliant with IPEV and AICPA guidelines. 4. Risk aware methodology.  5. Based on the most advanced research in the industry that does not compromise granularity, attention to detail, methodology rigor, and integrity of the valuation process.  6. Applicable to traditional private equity deals and funds, as well as hybrid structures that incorporate embedded options and contingencies.",https://www.facebook.com/Aspequity-Inc-334954120560316/?modal=admin_todo_tour,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Real Estate, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,

Icii Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/icii-technologies,2020-01-01,year,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Security, Machine Learning, Network Security, Security","Las Vegas, Nevada, United States","Icii Technologies specializes in the fields of artificial intelligence, smarter medicine, autonomous drones, and enhanced security.","1,565,253",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://icii.io/,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/icii-technologies,"Icii Technologies specializes in the fields of artificial intelligence, smarter medicine, autonomous drones, and enhanced security. Icii breaks the mold by combining our patent-pending algorithms with existing overlooked computer chips to place AI in every device, every sensor, and Everywhere.  ""Icii Technologies LLC (Icii), which stands for Integrated Circuit Inference Innovations, was founded by Michael Bass in October 2019 with the goal of putting “AI Everywhere”. Due to Bass’s experience developing custom computer chips, training artificial intelligence (AI) models, and writing high-level software, he observed that engineers in these respective fields rarely possess the domain knowledge of the others. Furthermore, he observed that there were other limitations that must be overcome to put AI Everywhere. For edge and remote systems, it is untenable to continue sending data to a server for AI processing due to connectivity, bandwidth, and latency issues. Even worse, readily available edge and remote systems are too limited in both processing and power consumption for real-time AI calculations.   Enter, Icii’s flagship service, its AI to chip platform (AI-CP). Icii’s AI-CP is an innovative technology that circumvents the previous issues and limitations by performing AI calculations not through software, but through hardware. Most importantly, the AI-CP has been developed with an intense focus on usability and differentiates itself from the competition as the easiest method to implement AI at the edge.    AI-CP, AI algorithm to chip design IP  Icii’s AI-CP is a SaaS product that generates custom chip design IP that makes AI inferencing faster, smaller, and lower power with a single press of the button. The AI-CP's competitive advantage lies in its innovative approach of generating a full AI chip design algorithmically and instantly. The IP is generated for a client’s specific AI algorithms, differentiating Icii’s solution from competitors whose products target general applications. Furthermore, the generated designs can take advantage of low-power high-throughput computer chips that are often overlooked due to their complexity and development life cycle. This makes it possible to place AI-CP’s generated IP in any camera, sensor, or device.  Offered as a SaaS product, the AI-CP requires a fixed amount of labor and can reach an unlimited number of clients. With a focus on usability, the AI-CP platform reduces development time and cost significantly while improving performance. Icii’s AI-CP develops in less than two minutes what at least three to twelve computer engineers would develop in six to eighteen months. This reduces development time and development cost by 90% and simultaneously improves performance by at least 400%.      To drive additional business into the AI-CP, Icii also offers EIE (pronounced eye) and consulting services.     EIE  EIE is a miniature circuit board that provides clients access to Icii’s AI-CP through a ready-to-use and cost-effective channel. In line with Icii’s focus on providing the simplest solution possible, EIE’s modular interfaces can be easily integrated into various systems, sensors, cameras, detectors, etc., enabling real-time analysis while greatly reducing development time and cost. The processing unit of EIE is a low-power high-throughput field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that would be incapable of AI inferencing without Icii’s AI-CP optimizations. EIE, in conjunction with the AI-CP, provides a computational speed-up of 400% and increases memory efficiency by 350% over competing for AI accelerators.   Consulting  Icii’s customer discovery has identified many potential clients that need real-time, high-performance, low-power AI processing at the data source but lack AI and electrical engineering teams capable of producing the needed solutions. To provide AI solutions for these clients’ needs, Icii Consulting provides full-stack AI to EIE, FPGA, or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) development. This is an ideal solution for original equipment manufacturers or partnering companies that excel at manufacturing, component integration, or product development and are seeking to incorporate AI to create a competitive advantage.""",,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Michael Bass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,
