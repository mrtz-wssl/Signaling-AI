Here's how: Integrated Sporting Goods: At the heart of our ecosystem lies our state-of-the-art sporting goods, like the ROOKIE Basketball. These aren't your run-of-the-mill equipment; each piece is embedded with advanced sensors that collect data as you play. Data Collection & Transfer: As users engage with our sporting goods, every movement, every score, and every skillful maneuver is captured. This data is then relayed to the ROOKIE mobile app in real-time. AI Analysis & Verification: Once the data reaches our cloud-hosted AI model, it undergoes a comprehensive analysis. The AI model identifies patterns, assesses the skill level, and verifies the authenticity of the gameplay. Tokenization & Rewards: Post-analysis, the authenticated data is directed to our distributed ledger. This ledger validates the transactions and, based on the player's performance, assigns rewards in the form of tokens. The better you play, the more you earn! Engaging Mobile UI: Players can track their performance, redeem their tokens, and even challenge others via the ROOKIE mobile app. It's not just about playing; it's about being part of a global community of sports enthusiasts. Multiple Play Modes: Whether you're an individual looking to practice (Free Play), wanting a head-to-head challenge (Quick Match), or teaming up for a group game (Teams), ROOKIE has a mode for you. Each mode offers unique rewards, ensuring players are continually engaged and motivated. Global Connectivity: With ROOKIE, geographical barriers are a thing of the past. Players from different corners of the world can connect, compete, and collaborate. Incentivization: Beyond the thrill of the game, players are incentivized for the time, energy, and passion they invest in sports. From skill points to PoS tokens, every achievement is recognized and rewarded. Community Building & Engagement: The ROOKIE ecosystem is more than just a product; it's a movement. From our podcast featuring NBA stars to strategic partnerships with industry leaders, we're fostering a global community bound by their love for sports. With ROOKIE, sports aren't just games; they're experiences, waiting to be lived and relished.

The Lead Broker is Jaime Brown, a former real estate agent with a strong background in decision and risk management. Her experience in both the corporate world and property market has made her essential in the lives of her clients.  This company has taken a personalized approach to every buyer and seller they work with. In the middle of a pandemic, it was this baseline that allowed Tampa Homestyles to quickly pivot in the face of new standards. By putting the clients' needs first, the company was able to promote new properties to buyers via virtual tours. The staff was also able to arrange for social distancing measures to ensure that relocating buyers could still see homes in person if they so chose. Jaime Brown founded the company because she noticed how her knowledge, experience, and skills could help buyers and sellers get more from every transaction. Too many deals in the industry are made without enough transparency. Buyers and sellers don't have the information they need to make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their portfolios. The website for Tampa Homestyles is packed with tips on how to increase home value, where to find a credible lender, and when it's time to close the deal. It's why people count on Tampa Homestyles Real Estate for advice on sales strategy, competitive market analysis, and risk assessment.  Jaime Brown understands the stakes of such high-value sales and works hard to achieve a fair outcome for all sides. In March, she served as the buyer's agent for a $6.4 million property on the waterfront. Her efficiency is built on metrics, and she approaches each decision with a healthy balance of caution and confidence.",https://www.facebook.com/tampahomestyles/,"Tampa Bay Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Real Estate",1,Jamie Brown,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,

Kelvin, the Founder and CEO of Smart Guider, was born hard of hearing and lost his vision at age 19.  Still, he graduated from San Diego State University with a degree in communication and went on to work with the State of California Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, helping blind people secure gainful employment. Kelvin then started an adaptive technology program to teach blind people the advanced computer skills needed to be competitive in workplace. Subsequently, he realized that many of his students had challenges independently traveling to his office, and he wanted to solve this problem.  Self-driving cars were the needed inspiration.  Kelvin started by teaching himself how to write the software code and built the first primitive prototype in 40 days.  He then realized that he would need to build a team of specialists, and so he recruited several volunteer software developers and mechanical and electrical engineers, who have been working together to build the current prototype. The Smart Guider is an evolved blind cane that uses an intelligent robot and a motorized wheel to guide the blind person when to move forward, backward, left, or right. The tech includes GPS, lidar, ultrasonic, computer vision, and radar sensors to recognize and avoid obstacles. Wayfinding, computer vision mapping, and active RFID then plot the course.
