Fundamentally, we believe too many people aren't being paid what they're worth.  It happens for a lot of reasons, but we believe with verified data and and the right support, we can get you the compensation you deserve. Earner helps you get paid fairly. First, we provide a free OfferScore, which is an evaluation of your offer letter (or letters) so you know how the offer measures up.  Most people focus on base and bonus when they look at their offers, but these only make up 70% of your total compensation. We thoroughly assess your PTO policies, 401K retirement plans, health benefits, commuter stipends, and many more to find the true value of your offer.  We build our free OfferScore by comparing your offers to thousands of others from companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, and privately-held startups - then use that data to help you negotiate effectively for a better compensation package. With an OfferScore in hand, we then work with you to build a Gameplan - that's what we call our partnering approach to negotiation.  For a flat fee, we work with you throughout the negotiation process to help you get what you deserve.  The Gameplan lays out an overall approach and specific guidance for every aspect of your negotiation, including likely counter-arguments.  We update the Gameplan as we work with you, so you always have our best advice and the right language to make your case.  If our work together doesn't result in an improved offer, you pay nothing - that's our commitment to seeing you succeed. Earner's mission is to make every professional feel valued and fulfilled by their work, and that can't happen if you're not being paid fairly.
