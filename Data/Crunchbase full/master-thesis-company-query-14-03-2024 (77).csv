Most students have some experience with drag and drop tools, but computer programming goes beyond the simplicity of drag and drop. With proper education in mind, The Programming Foundation focuses on education that is based on written instruction and concise documentation of examples and processes, as well as providing students with hands-on experience working together as a team by developing free and open source software projects to aid in global disaster relief and international humanitarian aid efforts for the public good. To that end, The Programming Foundation aims to meet several goals: The Programming Foundation commits to spreading awareness and education on computer programming and operating systems so that everyone is involved, and no one is left behind while the world advances. Our goal is for the widespread adoption of new and enhanced curriculum on computer programming and operating systems and for this knowledge to become mainstream in the general population. Without adequate instruction and training on advanced procedures in computer programming and operating systems, our children and the rest of the community will fall far behind technology. Automation is replacing jobs at a fast rate, and education behind that technology needs to ramp up to a similar speed. One way to stay on top of the continued advancements is to educate the general population and the younger generations on computer programming and operating systems. This education will produce a collaborative society that applies their collective knowledge toward technological innovations. We are already surrounded by devices that are smarter than the average human. This technology is becoming more widespread every day, and our lack of proper education on the subject leaves many behind on how it works. To keep everyone on the same level and to move society at the same speed as technology advances, we need to implement far-reaching educational systems to teach and learn how these technologies work. Together, we need to improve on our current educational processes and find better solutions. The Programming Foundation is dedicated to improving the available solutions so that we can make computer programming and operating systems education mainstream. We are committed to open-source and plan on developing and involving our volunteers in building industry standard technologies and applications that solve real-world problems and make the world a better place. Our objective is to maintain our goal of continuous technological developments and to encourage every citizen to learn more about computer programming and operating systems so that together, we are a smarter population.",https://www.facebook.com/smarterus,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Community and Lifestyle, Education, Hardware, Information Technology, Social Impact, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-11.36%,9,,,,,,,,,,

We have built multiple platforms that provides in-person and web-based tutoring as well as social media connecting services. Our tutoring platform is called Bayise Tutor and the social media platform is named Bayise Social. The platforms can be used together or as separate, standalone apps. Bayise Tutor makes it easier for tutors to conduct in-person and online classes and reach out to more students to enhance their earning potential. At the same time, the platform makes it easier for students to get access to tens of thousands of online tutors in their subjects. Students can find tutors for everything from homework support to subject comprehension in areas where they are struggling. Students can also find support in completing assignments. The Bayise Tutor platform has been in development since 2019. It was recently incorporated in March 2021. We have already signed on dozens of tutors within a short period of time and now looking to expand our services to customers. Once fully operational, we expect hundreds of thousands to millions of students to signup and benefit from the Bayise Tutor platform. Our platform aims to make education easier and non-disruptive for students that have been especially hurt by the ongoing pandemic and cancellation of their classes. Bayise Tutor will make it easier for students and parents to find the best tutors in their area to provide one-on-one and group classes. We are currently in the process of setting up offices that will be used as tutoring centers to accommodate thousands of students. Apart from the tutoring services, we are also building an online social media platform, Bayise Social, that is aimed specifically at students and young people.  Bayise Social will be a big social media platform that will offer advanced social media services such as posting, chatting, commenting, audio call, video call, live stream, group calls, advertising and much more.  The social media platform is available both on mobile apps and as a website. The revenue stream for the business will come as a percentage commission from tutor earnings. We are looking to become affiliated with local government,  education providers and  school districts to help them enhance their services. The social media platform will also generate revenue from advertisers who can pay to reach out to our users.

Anyone can use it freely in the comfort of their own home. It requires no effort and gives great results. Numerous studies have proven the effectiveness of fat freezing with over 19 clinical trials found on Google, including studies which prove that placing a frozen mass against targeted areas of the body for prolonged periods can kill off fat cells. The versatility of the bands means that you can perform fat freezing in the comfort and privacy of your own home. Around 40 years ago scientists observed children that ate a lot of popsicles developed dimples in their cheeks. They discovered that white fat cells are susceptible to cold temperatures, and when exposed to the right amount of cold for the right amount of time the white fat cells would literally freeze and die which caused dimples. This was the beginning of Fat Freezing, known as Cryolipolysis, which has now been scientifically proven with numerous studies. Subcutaneous fat, or white fat cells under the skin, are sensitive to cold. This is the thick fat found on your waist, hips, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, back, flanks and chests. By using your fat freezing band system on a target area or areas every day for a minimum of 3 weeks, combined with a diet and exercise plan, you can reduce the fat in that area up to 20-30%. Arm, legs, hips, stomach, back, waist, behind, man-boobs, muffin tops, love handles, wherever you have that stubborn fat, our system will reduce the fat while in the comfort of your own home.",https://www.facebook.com/freeze2trimofficial/,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Health Care, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
