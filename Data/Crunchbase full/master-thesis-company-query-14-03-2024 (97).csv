Corda is packed away, deep within the stack and performs the ultra fast and secure P2P transactions expected within distributed ledgering. However, this is like the layer underpinning TCP/IP on the internet, rather than the exposed dApps on most blockchain services. As with the internet, EyA then has multiple layers, including security and CorDapps, again, way below that which even developers will see or use. Instead, we reach up further through the stack to a plethora of API’s, which provide standardised access to data transactions and also to a unique method of creating a database of relational (and not so relational) data fields, which mimic that which an engineer would see within common relational databases like MS SQL This alone allows for rapid connectivity of a company’s current database solution to an interconnected data world. However, EyA takes this way beyond just “dumping” data and transacting within a particular industry. With the higher layers, it is ultra fast to connect to other industries, other data sets, other business operations from any sector, anywhere at anytime. Taking on the internet’s network of networks, EyA has also adopted this method with privacy of data leading the next frontier. Organisation data is never propagated across the EyA cloud, but instead only intrinsic parts of data required to perform any type of transaction are shared between the companies acting within that particular transaction, meaning private data is just that (finally). Again, though, EyA knows that there is data which needs to be open and seen by anybody, for instance product information which a consumer would want to read, or a firmware update to a household router. With the granular permission based solution way up in the layers, companies and even people can control exactly what others can see and partake in.",,"Greater Philadelphia Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're all New York City drivers ourselves, so we know how aggravating it is to spend precious time looking for a street parking spot. Between us we've been stuck doing it for a total of 70 years. We are adamant that the pain end. Unlike previous attempts to solve the street parking scourge, ParkYou! works completely in alignment with the way you currently drive and look for spots. It's designed to enable you and your neighbors to help each other. To do that, we are building real-world street parking communities around your home area first and then throughout the city in which you live. The ParkYou! app platform is easier to use than your favorite map app and, dare we say, even fun. We're realistic. We want ParkYou! to be a great aid, but we know it won't work all the time. Our initial goal is to enable you to find a spot near your home through the app at least 50% of the time, rising to 75-80% of the time throughout your entire city. Launching in NYC this Summer, we'll be growing to 30-40 cities globally. We truly hope you'll join us in ending the street parking hassle forever.

WeCare Holistic,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wecare-holistic,2018-09-11,day,"Alternative Medicine, Dental, Health Care, Health Diagnostics, Home Health Care, Personal Health","San Francisco, California, United States",Personalized holistic healthcare made easy.,"2,180,300",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://WeCareHolistic.com,https://twitter.com/WeCareHolistic,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wecare-holistic,"WeCare Holistic provides tailored services and products to help patients achieve optimal well-being, through easier access to personalized holistic healthcare at lower cost, both physically and financially. In reaching the goal of ""Personalized Holistic Healthcare Made Easy"", the company's sibling projects, Denti-Pal and Herbal-Pal, guard your health from your gateway to guts:  Denti-Pal: Personalized Oral Healthcare. Herbal-Pal: Your Personal Herbal Medicine Consultant.  Here are more details: 1. Denti-Pal <https://www.Denti-Pal.org>  1.1. What specific problem does Denti-Pal solve?  Many people are in a constant battle with oral health diseases such tooth decay and gum issues, but have no idea how to win. When they go to their dentist, they are being bombarded with new cavities, deep gum pockets, and other problems. Many have to pay constantly for treatments. Most of the time, patients are only informed that they have cavities and gum disease, rather than how those cavities and gum disease might have occurred.  Denti-Pal aims to solve this problem on how to prevent cavities, maintain healthy gums, and help people take control of their oral health. That way patients can save time, money and preserve their overall oral well being. After all, oral health is the gateway to general health. 1.2. Describe the solution, Denti-Pal:  With Denti-Pal, the focus is on preventing tooth decay and other gum issues through the use of powerful dental products. Denti-Pal takes into account the patient's health history and habits in order to provide them with a diagnosis on how high their cavity and periodontitis risk is. For example, 25% of people between ages 65-69 are taking 5 or more prescription medications. Many of these medications cause xerostomia as a side-effect, which combined with poor habits leads to an extreme risk for developing cavities; most patients do not know their risk is this high. Patients with diabetes are also at high risk for bone loss, which accelerates tooth loss due to gum issues. Denti-Pal is able to calculate the cavity risk level using CAMBRA (developed by UCSF and UOP dental schools) as well as bring gum disease risk awareness.  With this knowledge, patients can get a dental package tailored to their risk level needs. Patients with a higher risk level tend to get cavities due to factors they cannot control (such as genetics) or factors they are unaware of being correlated (such as dry mouth). Denti-Pal addresses these factors directly with the product kit to create an effective solution in preventing cavities, stopping gum disease, and improving oral health. 2. Herbal-Pal <https://www.Herbal-Pal.org> 2.1. What specific problems do Herbal-Pal solve?  2.1.1. Many US patients lack understanding and easy access to traditional medicine. Conventional Western Medicine has limitations in treating disorders requiring a top-down holistic system as well as novel diseases such as COVID-19. 2.1.2. Well trained herbal medicine practitioners, such as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors, are not allowed to “treat” COVID-19 patients in person by law in the US. Thus, US practitioners with experience healing COVID patients are concerned about legal troubles and do not want to publicize. However, they are willing to work with Herbal-Pal if we protect their licensure/business information, and take care of legal aspects while providing insurance.   2.1.3. Current healthcare system is costly and ineffective in prolonged war with COVID-19. While current mainstream allopathic medicine can solve some health issues, many conditions are still considered ""incurable"" or have “no special treatment”. Take COVID for example, mainstream media is anticipating vaccines to solve all problems, forgetting that vaccines are not for everyone. While early forms of vaccination were documented in 556 A.D., from TCM’s perspective, the immunization process only works for those who are healthy and strong. For those whose immune systems are not up to the extra burden, vaccines can shock the body by introducing “latent evils” and lead to unwanted consequences. 2.1.4. The one-size-fits-all mindset makes public health organizations reactive instead of proactive. They only take conservative, ineffective steps to avoid stepping on too many toes. For example, contrary to our early advocacy, the media and CDC have been changing faces about wearing masks.  2.2. Describe the solution, Herbal-Pal:  Herbal-Pal meets herbal medicine needs all in one spot. Patients are matched (based on specialties, availability, price range, and other nuances such as gender, languages spoken, former patient reviews) with curated traditional medicine doctors for remote consultations. Patients get personalized herbal prescription dispensed or patent formulae fulfilled and delivered anywhere. For those who have access to local herbal medicine doctors or herbs, they can choose to utilize part of Herbal-Pal service. Patients and providers will have a chance to leave multi-dimensional reviews for each other, and the feedback will become part of the underlying database.    The concept of Herbal-Pal is based on traditional medicine, with TCM being extensively used and well-documented among the world's medical traditions (e.g., Kampo in Japan, Ayurveda in India, complementary therapies in Switzerland, etc.). Most of the common health problems and many of the ""incurable"" issues can be treated with traditional medicine. Herbal-Pal currently offers a wide range of TCM doctors. We have seen some negative connotations coming from the media about TCM. In fact, just like how Arabic numbers do not have any political associations with Arabic countries, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is simply a name based on its location of origin. In fact, both traditional and modern medicines are pretty consistent although each has its advantages and limitations.    We believe far more US users can benefit from herbal medicine or the broader traditional medicine. The vision of Herbal-Pal is to become everyone’s personal traditional medicine consultant, like Upwork for herbal/ traditional/ integrative medicine.

Curated News is a news aggregation platform that provides misinformation proof news at a fraction of the cost of major companies, like Facebook, strengthening user information consumption habits without compromising democratic values.

Scandalous stories centered on outrage have been shown to increase user activity and ratings, deepening the cycle of misinformation. Who is it for? News is the primary mechanism people use to drive their daily decisions. Information quality is of the utmost importance for those who want to make high quality decisions, including consumers who want to get quality information faster. What makes it stand out from the crowd? There are currently no secure news aggregators that utilize the statistical methodology Curated News employs. Furthermore, there are no platforms that serve high quality information content while simultaneously producing democratic values. What’s next?
