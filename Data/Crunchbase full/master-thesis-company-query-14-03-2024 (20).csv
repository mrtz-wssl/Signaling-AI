Voter-turnout at all-time-high as politicians partner with Upvote to better understand their electorate on an issue-by-issue basis. Des Moines, IA – November 5, 2024 Voter turnout among those aged 18 - 35 has reached an all-time high this election cycle, thanks largely to widespread politician partnerships with Upvote. Upvote’s verified information has taken the guesswork out of politics, freeing representatives to act in the best interest of their constituents. Since their inception, Upvote has informed and empowered voters nationwide to instigate change within their political jurisdictions by providing a trusted connection between representatives and their constituents, culminating in a renewed sense of faith in American Institutions. “Before I started using Upvote, I had completely given up on politics,” Shared Nathan P. “I felt like most politicians had a hidden agenda - that they overlooked their constituents in favor of special interests. Now I want to participate because we’re seeing that change is possible.” Upvote transforms the way voters connect with their elected officials by providing a platform that groups, verifies, educates, and empowers them. Their curated, unbiased news feed keeps voters informed and up-to-date on their top policy interests and representatives. Politician ratings give a clear picture of how officials represent important issues. Issue tracking brings plain-language to complex policy and its impact on individuals and their communities. Representative profiles make it easy to understand motivations through campaign finance contributions by special interest, personal investments, voting history by issue, and unbiased bios. Most importantly, verification provides a direct line of communication between voters and their representatives, giving weight to the voice of verified constituents. “I never felt like I actually knew who these politicians were or how their actions matched their words.” shared John H. “I would try to research, but the information was so hard to find and to understand. Now I just check Upvote. Not only do I understand what’s going on, I can see how I’m influencing these outcomes in real-time. It’s addictive.” Beyond serving constituents, Upvote provides a critical service for politicians and their back-office staff. Through their constituent verification mechanism, Upvote has re-architected the public forum to cut through the inherent noise of traditional social media platforms. Officials now know that they’re communicating with real, verified voters in their jurisdiction. They are given a platform to explain their actions and beliefs directly to those that they represent. They are also equipped with granular, proprietary data regarding verified constituent sentiment across all key policy areas. This deep, informed connection allows them to better serve their constituents, and has allowed them to build a reputation through effective service instead of fundraising. “My top priority has always been to effectively serve my constituents, but there was no way for me to stay deeply connected with them at scale.” shared Congressman Brad T. “Aside from town halls and door knocking, it was difficult for me to gather the data-points I needed to serve them on every issue. Now, I check Upvote before every vote on the house floor. My constituents even help me draft language in the bills I bring to subcommittees. The best part is that I’ve gotten so much recognition for my service through Upvote that I don’t need to fundraise nearly as much. I can just focus on serving my community.” Through their platform, Upvote has proven that it is possible to disrupt traditional lobbying and campaign finance, placing democracy’s outcomes back in the hands of the voter.",,Midwestern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Software,1,Kasey Clary,1-10,1,,2023-05-12,50000,USD,50000,Debt Financing,,,,,,,,50000,USD,50000,Iowa Dept of Economic Development,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NATIVE LANGUAGES Most Social Listening tools analyze Sentiment under grammatical and semantic rules associated with the English language. However, Spanish, and other Romance languages ​​use countless contextual elements, making the interpretation of an expression above its literal meaning very challenging. In addition, elements such as sarcasm, ambivalence, double meaning, or implicit mischief are not easily classified by a tool whose operational and internal structure was designed to analyze English content.  Qaptum breaks this barrier, using AI and NLP, associated with regionalized libraries such as Mexican, Argentinian, or Spanglish, makes Qaptum an ideal tool for analyzing content specific to a country or region with a high level of precision. SENTIMENT VS. EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS Sentiment Analysis provides data points limited to reflect only Positive, Negative, and Neutral feelings in a conversation. In contrast, Emotional Analysis examines these sentiments in further detail and interprets them into specific behaviors.  For example, a Negative Sentiment can further be categorized into sad, angry, or skeptical, while a Positive Sentiment can be happy, optimistic, or enthusiastic.  Qaptum’s Emotions Engine, “available in Maximum and other advanced products,” offers an incomparable new dimension in understanding and interpreting the conversation around you. EASE OF USE, INTUITIVENESS Qaptum’s products are conceived and designed from inception to offer a superior user experience, granting a flawless, frictionless, easy to learn, and pleasant use of the product to enable full empowerment to use the system accurately, quickly through an efficient process.

People want and need power wherever they go.  Outdoor adventurers, travellers, military sector, humanitarian assistants or beneficiaries in areas of resilience, all have in common that they spend days away from home. During this period they seek to stay connected, safe and healthy, although to achieve this these people will require energy to charge their technological devices from anywhere when they are off-grid or outside the service network. Any of these people are surrounded by needs that include electronic devices, such as using a GPS, communicating on a smartphone, or turning on a lamp. So why is access to energy so important? The answer is simple, because when energy is not accessed, people's health and safety is at risk. That is why from Box Synergy we serve these people during these situations.

We presently operate 4 clinics in Sub-Saharan Africa with plans to expand into other markets in Africa and Europe. We’ve served over 1.2 million customers to date, including 425 babies delivered and thousands of vaccines administered. We are pointedly working to become the leading provider of healthcare and medical technology services in greater Africa within 3 years. We provide quality, affordable, and accessible care to huge populations that are currently underserved. Our offerings exceed that of the competition in a variety of ways: 1. We maintain low prices in order to reach the most customers possible and maintain the fierce brand loyalty and reputation we’ve earned. 2. Our growth strategy aims to provide all Sub-Saharan Africans access to a clinic in under two hours, and our templated clinic model ensures that customers know what to expect regardless of which location they visit. While other singley owned clinics are a gamble, our service is ubiquitous and reliable. 3. Our specialized clinics offer services not currently available in many locations, such as maternity care or emergency care. 4. Our on-demand services provide care for those unable to reach a clinic, as well as affluent customers who demand specialized attention. These will be expanded to reach more mainstream customers over time. 5. Our technological solutions, including universal medical records, patient analytics, and predictive AI elevate the standard of care to a new level. These features enable us to treat our patients proactively, while the rest of the industry still operates under a reactive model. In addition to these points, our work builds the foundation for a thriving social infrastructure. We bring with us a sizeable need for skilled labor and education. Our presence is already driving significant traffic to the areas where we operate, resulting in local industries flourishing around our clinics.
