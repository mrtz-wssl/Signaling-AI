It would be an honor if you would allow me the opportunity to introduce myself and explain what we offer in the field of Industrial Automation and Integration.  Foremost, I am a follower of Christ. The company is designed around moral design, which comes with such a declaration. Without Christ, we are nothing. As the CEO of the company, it is my magnificent obsession to see your process, company, employees, and customers receive the highest level of service that can be offered in the industry. Titan is not only raising the bar in this industry we are redefining and redesigning the bar itself.  How are we doing that? Just to carry the title of Titan requires greater than five years of hands-on systems knowledge. Titans must be experts in a minimum of five separate applications with robotics and must have extensive PLC expertise. All of which a Titan is certified in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Titans are truly the pinnacle of the industry! What does that mean to you and your company? It means that when you call Titan Group you get the best in the industry. Titans have paid their dues to this industry and have earned their title through overcoming unbelievable odds to accomplish their mission. Why would you choose Titan Group over any other company? As a company, we are young. We just got our Tax ID last year. However, the personnel in the company have decades of experience in multiple areas of automated manufacturing and process automation controls: We created the company as a means to not only care for our families but to actually bring people on who had our same values. We are tired of seeing large companies take smaller companies to the bank just to make a few extra dollars. Instead, we are better than the bigger companies and we care more because at the end of the day it is our families’ name that is on our work, not just Titan's. Other companies offer a body, one person who is versed either in one or maybe three of the required fields which you may need. We offer a one stop full integration service that is truly not just setting the bar but redefining the bar itself. Titan offers something that no other company in the world offers: a TITAN. Truly a professional expert who is driven by our core values. God First, Military Precision, and Deeply ingrained obsession. If you are going to do something, you cannot do anything except through Christ, Phil. 4:13. If you are going to put your name on it you must have such a diligent precision that even the world’s greatest military would take notice. However, if you are going to be the one with the answers you must be completely and thoroughly obsessed with your outcome that it almost becomes an addiction. Titans are all of these simply for the drive of being the best that we can be.  It would be an honor to introduce Titan and myself to you and your company.  How to contact Titan: You are more than welcome to call, text, email, or even write a letter.  I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.  Thank you for your time and may God bless you and yours.",,"East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are contracted to represent an impressive portfolio of industry leaders within the telecommunications and cellular industries. Many inquire about how we came to work with the names that we do, and the answer is two-fold. Firstly, we work with a broker that has over 20 years experience and is known as THE #1 outsourced marketing firm in the country. Their reputation has acquired the likes of clients that top the Fortune 500 list. After experiencing sub-par results from indirect marketing methods (billboards, radio ads, tv commercials, etc), big brands turned to our broker to handle all face to face customer acquisitions, and our broker turned to us. The second reason is Vatamanu Consulting's ability to incur all advertising, hiring, onboarding, and training costs to produce the best representation and results for our clientele! By increasing the number of new customers, retention, and satisfaction of existing customers, Vatamanu Consulting's clients have returned the favor by creating ample advancement opportunities for team members. With a clear and concise growth path, we look to train entry-level marketing and sales professionals into successful campaign managers. An emphasis on merit-based growth and advancement ensures our client is represented by the cream of the crop. Vatamanu Consulting proves that with the right team, training, and principles in place, rapid growth is possible. With our sights set on expanding into two additional cities in the next year, ambitious, competitive, and goal-oriented are three of the many adjectives we would use to describe our growing team.

The book deals with life’s storms that the boy and his son experienced and how their faith, in particular as practiced in their everyday lives, affected, and strengthened them so that they could move through the storms of life and emerge from the eye of those storms, remaining strong and committed in their Faith.  There is a stark comparison of life under the oppression of Muslim radicals seeking to eliminate Christianity; life under the control of the Nazi and Gestapo tyranny; and life under the Constitution of the United States where we are guaranteed freedom of religion, speech, choice, and the other rights granted Citizens of these United States of America.  The author warns future generations to not overlook the price paid for these freedoms; and that, if ignored, the suppression, tyranny and genocide that was suffered by our forefathers, which still exists in other parts of the world, can be experienced again by us, even here, in the United States of America.",,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,

Our clients hire us for our marketing services because our business model is built off making their potential and current customers feel like gold!
