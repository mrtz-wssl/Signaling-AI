DeSo is backed by Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and many others. Our mission is to decentralize social media the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. As a layer-1 blockchain, DeSo can be compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc... However, DeSo has several major advantages over these platforms, the largest being that it is designed to power storage-heavy applications (like social applications and marketplaces). To put it in perspective, storing just a 200-character ""Tweet"" on Ethereum costs ~$80, and costs ~$0.25-$1.00+ on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and virtually all other smart contract chains. In contrast, it costs 1/1,000th of a penny on DeSo, which is why breakthrough apps like Diamond, DAODAO, Pearl, OpenProsper, NFTz, and Entre, now possible exclusively on DeSo. Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin. A handful of private entities effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create. Society’s answer to financial centralization was not to put Warren Buffett in charge of money, it was to use technology, namely Bitcoin, so we could have nobody in charge. We believe the same type of technology will cause this conclusion to ultimately play out in social. DeSo’s advantages make it capable of breaking this status quo for the first time, and bringing competition and innovation back to social in much the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum have done for our financial system.

REA is an ""Owner Backed"" Company. A concise answer to ""What does REA do?"" is available here: https://reliableenergyanalytics.com/  The patented SAG™ Methods and SAGScore™ trust score for app stores (US 11374961) and Software Assurance Guardian™ (SAG™) Point Man™  (SAG-PM™) software supply chain risk assessment application has continued to evolve and improve, and now stands at version 1.2, with support for both SPDX and CycloneDX SBOM formats. SAG-PM™ has been developed to help protect small and medium sized companies from malicious software objects and untrustworthy parties that may have compromised the integrity of a software supply chain, preventing the installation of bad, harmful software, i.e. ransomware, into an operational system.  REA has become the de-facto testing partner for the NTIA SBOM community, serving in the role of a software consumer for SBOM interoperability testing with numerous software vendors. REA is an IEEE Entrepreneurship Program Member and an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Activate Company.  REA is an active Member of the DHS CISA Critical Manufacturing Sector Coordinating Council (CMSCC), DHS CISA ICT_SCRM Task Force, Software Assurance Work Group developing tools to help small and medium businesses secure their software supply chains and prevent the installation of ransomware and other malware and the IETF Supply Chain Integrity Transparency and Trust (SCITT) work group. Never trust software, always verify and report!™ SAG-PM™performs a patented (US 111374961) software supply chain risk assessment process containing seven critical investigative steps on a software object's installation file as part of a comprehensive software supply chain risk assessment process that calculates a SAGScore™, indicating a level of Trustworthiness for the software object itself and parties serving roles within the software supply chain. A SAGScore™  is conceptually similar to a FICO Score, but for software trustworthiness of a software object to perform as expected. When applied to apps on app stores the SAGScore™ gives a software consumer visibility into the trustworthiness of each app, which can help consumers decide which app to install from a set of search results, based on the highest SAGScore™. These seven steps implement best practices to augment NERC CIP-010-3 software verification standards by applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework V1.1 and the NTIA Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standards recognized by the Department of Commerce NTIA SBOM initiative. The May 12, 2021 Cybersecurity Executive Order, 14028, mandates that Federal Agencies and Departments require all software vendors of critical software to provide SBOM's as part of their software product distributions. An SBOM will enable Federal buyers of software products to conduct a software risk assessment, using SAG-PM™, to determine the trustworthiness of a software package, prior to installation. This ""proactive"" risk assessment can detect harmful malware, such a ransomware and other nefarious software, preventing it from being installed in a digital ecosystem, where it can cause damages.  An AWS cloud based SAGServer™ provides database and other support services to the SAG-PM™ software application, including a List of Trusted Software Objects in the SAG-CTR™ Community Trust Registry along with their SAGScore™, that have been digitally signed, which the SAG-PM™ user community has identified as trustworthy. Software products that receive multiple trust registrations from the SAG-PM™ end user community can receive the SAG-STAR™ label to indicate their high level achievement of trustworthiness. The new SEC cybersecurity rules are placing more responsibility, and liability for cybersecurity controls/protections on Officers and Directors. The SAG-CTR includes a ""Secure Evidence Locker"" where tamper-proof evidence of proactive cybersecurity controls to monitor for CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability (KEV) risks in software assets is stored to aid Officers and Directors in mounting a defense against any shareholder lawsuits, in the event of a cyber-incident, that must be report within 96 hours under the SEC Cybersecurity rules that go into effect December 2023. The SAG user documentation also includes an appendix containing a description of processes, policies and practices for cyber-risk detection and risk management in the software Supply Chain, i.e., CISA KEV's,needed for disclosure to the SEC, starting in December 2023. REA has open-sourced its, free to use, Vendor Response File Format and Vulnerability Disclosure Report XML schemas to help software vendors and consumers exchange critical information required to meet Executive Order 14028 and the new ""SBOM Bill"" making its way through Congress, H.R. 4611; A sample use case showing all required evidence data for a comprehensive risk assessment is available online at:  https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/tree/master/C-SCRM-Use-Case   open source XML VRF and NIST Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) schemas are available here:  https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products  REA is a proud member of the IEEE Entrepreneurship program and an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Activate partner.

In 1988, Wonderware transformed how machines run, with the introduction and mass commercialization of Human-Machine Interface software. Wonderware enabled the first software-based industrial revolution and is still in evidence today by Wonderware’s continued leadership position. In 1998, Lighthammer transformed manufacturing yet again with the introduction of the first Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence platform. Lighthammer revolutionized the factory floor by bringing both real time intelligence and live synchronization with the ERP software layer. This enabled the second software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of this software (currently under the SAP MII brand). In 2008, ThingWorx catalyzed the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with the introduction of the first application platform for IIoT. ThingWorx transformed both manufacturing and service, becoming synonymous with Industrie 4.0/Brilliant factory, and Connected Service. This enabled the 3rd software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of IIoT software and, the market leadership of PTC’s ThingWorx brand. In 2018, the founders of Augmentir recognized that the technology and market forces were aligned yet again, for a fourth industrial software revolution. A revolution focused on increasing the productivity & quality of processes involving front-line workers. With a global footprint of 350 million workers in manufacturing and service, they are being asked to perform increasingly complex jobs using technology that has remained relatively unchanged for 20 years.
