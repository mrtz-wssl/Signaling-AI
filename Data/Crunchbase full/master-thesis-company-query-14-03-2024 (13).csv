Hour25.ai has developed and tested a unique mobile platform that increases focus by detecting for the user, in real-time, when his emotional state has driven him into the ‘hands’ of social networks. Then - help the employee boost attention using behavioral interventions targeted by these focus-negative feelings.  For example, when they validate that they’re bored, we provide them with a psychological exercise (video, quiz, short reading, music, etc.) to shift their focus towards where their focus lane is. For example - the boredom quiz asks them questions that help them understand the core reasons they are bored, which pulls them out of the unwanted emotional situation.

The result of neglected and aging grid infrastructure, our founder sought a way to circumvent the grid altogether. He applied his 30+ years of experience in electric motor and battery technology to develop a compact yet robust microgrid system—a system that enables residential and commercial consumers alike to become grid independent and maximize the ROI on their solar, wind and hydro energy investments.  Personal experience and extensive research have led us to the conclusion that the prevailing battery backup solutions on the market are not cutting it. These sub-15 kWh systems provide little more than half-a-days power to the average American home, which consumes 30 kWh/day. Something more is needed. Like most people, our founder knew that he would never possess the massive solar arrays and battery storage to make sustainable living possible. He also personally felt the expense burden of generators and energy storage devices that cost him thousands of dollars up front, and thousands more in fuel and energy rationing down the road. With a breached pain threshold, he set out to make a change.  That change was Blue Power Systems. Offering a patent-pending, state-of-the-art hybrid microgrid system, BPS provides users a new solution—a self-sufficient unit that supports the average American home without energy rationing and without exorbitant fuel costs. The system keeps users energy independent by relying on multiple energy sources: renewable energy (such as solar, wind or hydro), grid energy (if available/whenever it’s cheap), and also generator energy (which charges the system batteries directly). Grid down? Use your generator and solar. Solar panels not working? Use your wind turbine and grid charge. Alternatives make our product practical.  Blue Power Systems is unique because of our hybrid approach, efficient generator system, and greater battery capacity. Typical generators run 24 hours (27.5 gallons/day) to power a home, releasing energy that may or may not get used while constantly emitting harmful gasses and particulate matter. Blue Power Systems runs its generator for 2.5 hours (2.875 gallons/day) to accomplish the same job; that’s 90% less fuel, 90% less pollution.  Further, our units include a revolutionary BLADE exhaust filter that are lab-proven to reduce PM 2.5 by 72% as well as Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by 12%––meaning that our already efficient generation system has even more environmental protections in place. To top it off, 64 decibels at 20 feet make us quieter than a standard AC unit. An intuitive system control center enables users to customize their needs: renewable energy priority, cost priority, etc. The intelligent algorithms present both immediate and predictive data to the user via an elegant mobile phone app, which also displays real-time data collection concerning energy storage/usage/production.  People are beginning to look elsewhere as centralized power continues to falter. Blue Power Systems is not just a product, we're a movement.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Ray Caamano,1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,2019-11-22,25000,USD,25000,Series A,25000,USD,25000,Series A,205000,USD,205000,205000,USD,205000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It will also provide online AI professional services like customer service, personal assistant, financial advisor, medical, legal, and other more advanced ones using an advanced language interface for speech and text. https://youtu.be/YE31u1FmoyA https://youtu.be/YE31u1FmoyA ORBAI is working on a new AI architecture with proprietary neural nets, tools, and processes that allow us to build advanced sensory processing and memory systems that mimic the human brain's ability to perceive, remember, predict, and plan. With this and the built in language capability, our Human AI Interface is able to be a powerful conversational voice assistant on platforms like mobile, smart homes and appliances, and in your vehicle, and also perform real information and customer-facing vocations online, like Medical, Finance, Legal, and others. As the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) core advances, it becomes more powerful, with a broader data reach, and more advanced cognition, planning, prediction, vocational and communication skills. Companies could use it to plan their corporate strategy via their current Enterprise Resource Planning tools by interfacing them to our AGI and having it watch and learn their company’s internal operations, gather data about their whole ecosystem of customers, suppliers, partners, competitors, and the other market factors, then forecast different timelines and how they evolve into the future differently according to their decisions, allowing you to optimize their corporate decision-making and plan effective prescient timelines for product development, marketing/PR, sales, finance, legal,… into the future. Ordinary people can use it to plan their lives, evaluating different decisions they could make, from career, to marriage, to finances, and to see the trajectory of events that would result, and the probable outcomes. They can access AGI professional services like Finance, Legal, Medical, Counselor, Fitness Advisor, and hundreds of others, and these services would be available globally, rivaling the best such services by humans.

Soon we realized the cost of adapting these technologies were too high. This created a big and unnecessary barrier for most organizations to benefit from that. Additionally, it became obvious to us that people were forced to interact with machines in a machine-way (point and click), not a human way (write, speak). This has shaped our vision, mission and our product set. Today, our increasingly digital, always-on world is transforming the way companies function on a daily basis. People now have the ability to control who they interact with, when, and how. So, we’re creating a world where businesses can stay constantly connected to their customers, their way.

BitPlus Hosting (BPH) BPH will offer the only known Single-Phase Liquid Immersion Cooling (SLIC) hosting solution available in North America providing its Cryptomining and Data Center customers a competitive advantage through increased equipment efficiencies. The use of immersion cooling, over time we believe it will render current air-cooled technology obsolete.  In providing greater efficiency to our hosted clients BPH experiences superior client retention and will establish itself as an industry leader in both quality and quantity of clients served, both in Cryptomining and Data. In preparation to capitalize on our power build out, BitPlus Hosting intends to acquire current cryptomining hosting and mining companies and convert them to immersion at their facilities or consolidate their operations to our facilities with extremely low electricity costs.  An added benefit to BPH is that profitability in our own mining operations will be superior to traditional mining and hosting companies, see “BitPlus Capital” below.  Our internal mining expertise is magnified with superior low-cost electricity rates. We produce our own electricity, with our own equipment, from surplus natural gas at rates under $0.03/kWh by way of our owned company, Global Northern Resources, LLC. Global Northern Resources, LLC (GNR)  GNR produces large volume, low cost electricity on owned real estate. We then lease space and land, in conjunction with long-term high margin electricity contracts to clients with large megawatt power needs including; Data processing, Data storage, High-tech manufacturing (I.e. plastics & electronics), Gaming, Cryptomining, Vertical Farming, Logistics & Distribution, Warehousing and Multi-use Land Development projects. Low cost power acquisition is a cornerstone for GNR’s immediate and long-term growth.  Our short-term objective will be to produce 250 MW of electricity by year-end 2021, 500 MW of electricity by year-end 2022 and 1,000MW of electricity by year-end 2024.  We currently have 40MW completed in Colorado Springs, CO with an additional 50MW ready for build out.  In Grand Forks, ND we have 30MW completed with an additional 100MW site identified and in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada we have 58MW available for acquisition.  Our 250MW objective in 2021 will be realized upon meeting our funding objectives.   BitPlus Technologies (BPT) BPT is developing a new, disruptive technology for cryptomining.  Our team of computer scientists have vast experience developing the microchips currently used in the most efficient miners available today.  Our goal is to manufacture a miner specifically designed for immersion cooling.  Once completed and in production our miners will use less electricity and produce the highest possible hashrate currently available in cryptomining.   BitPlus Capital (BPC)   BitPlus Holdings, Ltd (BPHL) also mines cryptocurrency for its own portfolio through our investment firm BitPlus Capital (BPC).  The goal of BitPlus Capital is to generate coins, at institutional volume, below market prices greatly enhancing profitability prior to the management of mined coins. BPC has consistently demonstrated an expertise to generate digital currency far below retail market cost.  Collectively, BPHL encompasses electric power supply and real estate through Global Northern Resources, mining and data hosting through BitPlus Hosting, equipment manufacturing through BitPlus Technologies, and portfolio management through BitPlus Capital.  BPHL in conjunction with BPC, BPH and BPT has as its objective to launch a successful public company while controlling in excess of 10% of Bitcoin hashrate.",,Midwestern US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Software",4,"Kenneth Abrams, Steven Harris, Timothy Brogan, Tom Blasen",1-10,1,Seed,2018-04-27,406957,USD,406957,Seed,406957,USD,406957,Seed,406957,USD,406957,406957,USD,406957,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,
