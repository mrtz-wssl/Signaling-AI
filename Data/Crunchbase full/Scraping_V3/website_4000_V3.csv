The company is registered in the US, based in Boston (with presence in Jerusalem), and is currently at the clinical stage. SynergyMed platform technology may be used as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of early-stage breast, head and neck, skin, and lung cancers for humans and also for the veterinary market. It may also be used for palliative care to relieve pain. The proven technology can locally ablate and destroy cancer tumors, precisely and effectively, without causing any damage to the surrounding healthy tissues. It is based on using specialized electromagnetic applicators which are placed around the region of interest. FDA approved nanoparticles are injected inside the tumor, which absorb the radiated electromagnetic energy efficiently, destroying the tumor without damaging the healthy tissue. The device is controlled through the company’s own developed algorithms which optimize the ablation process while precisely tracking temperature and measuring the administered treatment dose. The company has performed mice studies with breast cancer cell line, showing exceptional results, where the tumor disappeared within only a few days, leaving no scars or traces of cosmetic damage. It has also performed studies on superficial tumors in dogs with excellent results.  SynergyMed Devices Inc. has an experienced team with backgrounds from leading corporate and academic institutions.

Concept The Pitch Place is here to make freelance journalism a whole lot easier. Our goal is to enable media professionals around the world with the connections they need to tell the stories that matter. In a world where journalists are often taking physical and/or financial risks to work in the field they love as freelancers, the Pitch Place is working to try and reduce those risks every way we can. We are creating a network of media professionals -- including editors, content producers, writers, photographers, videographers, fixers, translators, and experts -- so that: - when breaking news happens, media outlets can easily locate the best freelance talent they need to cover the story immediately - freelancers can pitch story ideas efficiently, based on their expertise and qualifications - editors only receive alerts to story ideas that match their criteria - community standards on pricing, fairness, and copyright are met and respected - journalists know they are working with professionals with a proven track record in the industry - getting paid for a job well done is standard policy - finding the right journalism job for you is a click away How does it work: In each of the following sections, media professionals can connect with each other, agree on the terms of a job, and, once completed, pay and get paid for a job well done. Pitches The Pitch Place is a like a dating service for journalists and editors: each fill out their profile and when a pitch is posted only those who are a match for each other will get an email alert about the details of the pitch. Meanwhile, the teaser and title of the pitch are posted in the community Pitch feed for all registered members to see. Grants, fellowships, awards, events, and PR announcements are also posted on this feed and members can filter the feed to suite their needs. Jobs Journalism jobs, contract positions, freelance gigs -- anything that requires hiring the skills of a media professional are listed on our community Jobs feed.

We unite music artists, curators, and consumer music audiences in one cohesive and intuitive community and marketplace. We help listeners discover and champion new artists, new music, and new music communities, and help artists discover, grow, and sell directly to these audiences. We believe that creators are micro-businesses - they need tools, data, and insights so they can grow and earn. We connect creators with communities of audiences - helping them leverage actionable data and monetize fragmented audiences that other platforms fail to capture or expose. We're initially focused on music - giving independent & emerging music artists tools to earn 10x more than they would from streaming royalties alone while saving them time and reducing critical barriers to market entry and consumer discovery.
