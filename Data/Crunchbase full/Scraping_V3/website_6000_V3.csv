Like the world's largest ride-share company, Uber Technologies, PRIMEDIA uses disruptive technology that will simplify how any business can buy mass media. The company with its MMS software also sells unsold local radio, cable TV, OTT, newspaper, and billboards. There is no company in the country that can do what PRIMEDIA does and this is a complete game changer for businesses that now will have a one-stop source for all of their advertising media needs.  PRIMEDIA is a national company that can go global. Nationally it will do $100’s of millions in sales and profits, globally it will do billions. And this is not 5 years down the road -- this is a realistic number right now with the proper funding in place. As an Accredited Investor, Angel Investor, Venture Capitalist, or Broker Dealer, you have made very smart decisions with investments in companies with large growth potential. And now, with an investment into the PRIMEDIA Network, you can add a company with true limitless capability and see a dramatic return on investment for yourself or your clients. We are looking for equity investments or convertible debt for a global company with enormous sales and profits.

(Some firms only run local court background checks, and contractors sometimes have no background checks at all.)         In addition to a background check, all of our employees have their background monitored throughout their employment so if something new happens, we will be notified immediately.

Very often, the contractors are uninsured.) We provide workers compensation insurance for our employees, so if they are injured on the job, they are well taken care of.
