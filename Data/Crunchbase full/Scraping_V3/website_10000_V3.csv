We are diligent, energetic, competitive, and team-centered. We believe our early success as a company revolves around the people we work with and their development. Our team is dynamic, coming from various backgrounds. Our common ground lies in our passion for growth and desire to raise the bar. For that reason, we like to describe our company as a leadership development firm that just happens to do sales. Our success has lead us to be fortunate enough to work with some of the leading telecommunications, solar, energy, satellite, cable, and internet firms and we’re only growing our client base. People may ask themselves, why do these name brand companies want to outsource their marketing? There are numerous reasons but the two ones we find most important are: time and money. In outsourcing their direct marketing team to Catalyst Endeavors, we lower the overhead cost for these firms. They no longer worry about recruiting costs, hiring and onboarding costs, training costs, retaining costs, and sales quotas. Catalyst Endeavors gives them back all the time and energy they would have spent to build their team. Now, instead of worrying about expanding their market share with a skilled and motivated sales team, they get to reinvest their time in building a better and newer product. Why do these companies trust us so much, though? Simple: they have seen our systems and strategies work first-hand and know how systematic our company truly is. We stay up-to-date on product knowledge, training methods, and leadership teachings, and instill our team with the skills to be their best. Instead of focusing our training strictly on getting the sale, we teach our people how to communicate effectively, actively listen, and assess the situation quickly with a level-head. Our goal as a company is to develop leaders who will impact their community.

WeCare Holistic,2018-09-11,https://WeCareHolistic.com,"San Francisco, California, United States",Health Care,"Alternative Medicine, Dental, Health Care, Health Diagnostics, Home Health Care, Personal Health",2180300.0,"WeCare Holistic provides tailored services and products to help patients achieve optimal well-being, through easier access to personalized holistic healthcare at lower cost, both physically and financially. In reaching the goal of ""Personalized Holistic Healthcare Made Easy"", the company's sibling projects, Denti-Pal and Herbal-Pal, guard your health from your gateway to guts:  Denti-Pal: Personalized Oral Healthcare. Herbal-Pal: Your Personal Herbal Medicine Consultant.  Here are more details: 1. Denti-Pal <https://www.Denti-Pal.org>  1.1. What specific problem does Denti-Pal solve?  Many people are in a constant battle with oral health diseases such tooth decay and gum issues, but have no idea how to win. When they go to their dentist, they are being bombarded with new cavities, deep gum pockets, and other problems. Many have to pay constantly for treatments. Most of the time, patients are only informed that they have cavities and gum disease, rather than how those cavities and gum disease might have occurred.  Denti-Pal aims to solve this problem on how to prevent cavities, maintain healthy gums, and help people take control of their oral health. That way patients can save time, money and preserve their overall oral well being. After all, oral health is the gateway to general health. 1.2. Describe the solution, Denti-Pal:  With Denti-Pal, the focus is on preventing tooth decay and other gum issues through the use of powerful dental products. Denti-Pal takes into account the patient's health history and habits in order to provide them with a diagnosis on how high their cavity and periodontitis risk is. For example, 25% of people between ages 65-69 are taking 5 or more prescription medications. Many of these medications cause xerostomia as a side-effect, which combined with poor habits leads to an extreme risk for developing cavities; most patients do not know their risk is this high. Patients with diabetes are also at high risk for bone loss, which accelerates tooth loss due to gum issues. Denti-Pal is able to calculate the cavity risk level using CAMBRA (developed by UCSF and UOP dental schools) as well as bring gum disease risk awareness.  With this knowledge, patients can get a dental package tailored to their risk level needs. Patients with a higher risk level tend to get cavities due to factors they cannot control (such as genetics) or factors they are unaware of being correlated (such as dry mouth). Denti-Pal addresses these factors directly with the product kit to create an effective solution in preventing cavities, stopping gum disease, and improving oral health. 2. Herbal-Pal <https://www.Herbal-Pal.org> 2.1. What specific problems do Herbal-Pal solve?  2.1.1. Many US patients lack understanding and easy access to traditional medicine. Conventional Western Medicine has limitations in treating disorders requiring a top-down holistic system as well as novel diseases such as COVID-19. 2.1.2. Well trained herbal medicine practitioners, such as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors, are not allowed to “treat” COVID-19 patients in person by law in the US. Thus, US practitioners with experience healing COVID patients are concerned about legal troubles and do not want to publicize. However, they are willing to work with Herbal-Pal if we protect their licensure/business information, and take care of legal aspects while providing insurance.   2.1.3. Current healthcare system is costly and ineffective in prolonged war with COVID-19. While current mainstream allopathic medicine can solve some health issues, many conditions are still considered ""incurable"" or have “no special treatment”. Take COVID for example, mainstream media is anticipating vaccines to solve all problems, forgetting that vaccines are not for everyone. While early forms of vaccination were documented in 556 A.D., from TCM’s perspective, the immunization process only works for those who are healthy and strong. For those whose immune systems are not up to the extra burden, vaccines can shock the body by introducing “latent evils” and lead to unwanted consequences. 2.1.4. The one-size-fits-all mindset makes public health organizations reactive instead of proactive. They only take conservative, ineffective steps to avoid stepping on too many toes. For example, contrary to our early advocacy, the media and CDC have been changing faces about wearing masks.  2.2. Describe the solution, Herbal-Pal:  Herbal-Pal meets herbal medicine needs all in one spot. Patients are matched (based on specialties, availability, price range, and other nuances such as gender, languages spoken, former patient reviews) with curated traditional medicine doctors for remote consultations. Patients get personalized herbal prescription dispensed or patent formulae fulfilled and delivered anywhere. For those who have access to local herbal medicine doctors or herbs, they can choose to utilize part of Herbal-Pal service. Patients and providers will have a chance to leave multi-dimensional reviews for each other, and the feedback will become part of the underlying database.    The concept of Herbal-Pal is based on traditional medicine, with TCM being extensively used and well-documented among the world's medical traditions (e.g., Kampo in Japan, Ayurveda in India, complementary therapies in Switzerland, etc.). Most of the common health problems and many of the ""incurable"" issues can be treated with traditional medicine. Herbal-Pal currently offers a wide range of TCM doctors. We have seen some negative connotations coming from the media about TCM. In fact, just like how Arabic numbers do not have any political associations with Arabic countries, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is simply a name based on its location of origin. In fact, both traditional and modern medicines are pretty consistent although each has its advantages and limitations.    We believe far more US users can benefit from herbal medicine or the broader traditional medicine. The vision of Herbal-Pal is to become everyone’s personal traditional medicine consultant, like Upwork for herbal/ traditional/ integrative medicine.

Paying via debit at the PoS in CO, CA, and other more developed industries exists, however, these systems operate as disguised ATMs, and incur many different fees as a result. This leads to a markup of >$10-15 in most cases. Rhizomatiq is a DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Utility Token based on the DAG-Tangle architecture; this allows for high efficiency, resistance to attacks, environmentally green operations and most importantly an incredibly high throughput rate for instant transaction authorization. Built on top of the DLT is a suite of Supply Chain Track/Trace algorithms that provide transparency up the Cannabis Supply Chain for Regulators, Consumers, Suppliers, and Merchants alike. This suite is a logistics tracing mechanism, that follows batches of tested Cannabis products throughout the distribution process; from seed, to sale. Rhizomatiq aims to streamline this process, and act as a base for the Cannabis industry to build on. Due to the efficiency and scalability of the DAG-Tangle architecture, we are able to offer extraordinarily low fees (.25% S2M / $1 C2M per Tx), and instantly approved transactions. The process is simple and intuitive. SEND / RECEIVE transaction pairs represent completed ""seeds"". These seeds are stored on ""nodes"", our word for the Account Tangle architecture. Transactions on the node are verified using a standard Random Selection algorithm. Before either a SEND or RECEIVE transaction is sent, a dense regulatory compliance process is completed in which the Account Holder's ability to partake in the transaction is verified. Rhizomatiq Tokens are Utility Tokens, therefore transactions are initiated as payment transfers to and from the senders and receivers payment methods, respectfully, and the Tokens themselves will never be able to be Bought or Sold.",1-10,1.0,Seed,2022-03-01,0.0,Seed,0.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,2,2,2022,67530,False,False
