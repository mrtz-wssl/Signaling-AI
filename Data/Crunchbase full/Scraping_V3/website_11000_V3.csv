Gleenr is a sophisticated emotional mapping software that can give you insight about a particular person or situation by gleening non-verbal cues from a video. When you upload a video to Gleenr we measure the facial micro-movements and physical attributes that are displayed. These measurements give us clues, as to how the person was feeling about what they're saying. The results of our measurements, “the gleen,” can give you some additional insight so you can move forward in this situation with a little more knowledge. We’re not the only resource for you to validate if someone's being sincere but we can give you a little help. This is especially important in situations where you're not meeting in person and can’t get a good gut reaction for yourself. It can also be helpful if you’re feeling as if something just isn’t quite right but can’t quite put your finger on it. The added information Gleenr can provide can give just enough distance and objectivity to move forward in a way that is safe and beneficial for you. WHAT WE MEASURE & WHAT IT TELLS US Gleenr software tracks eye movements and facial muscles using scanning technology tracking 4 layers deep. The scanned information is applied to an algorithm to determine overall sincerity, with moment-to-moment measurements of satisfaction, anger, disgust, stress, excitement, and even neutral ambivalent emotions. Gleenr also tracks physical attributes and changes in heartbeat, breathing, and blood pressure. These physiological factors have long been associated with emotional responses and can be a good indicator if something is simmering beneath the surface. Having a roadmap of these responses can give you a heads up if things may be not what they seem. WHAT WE DON'T DO... Gleenr isn’t facial recognition software and we don’t retain any biometric data that can be used to identify people. We can’t tell you who the people are in a video, we can only interpret how they may be feeling based on non-verbal cues. We also don’t share your video gleens with any third parties. The videos uploaded and analyzed are done so privately and confidentially. This information is for you, we are committed to your privacy and value discretion in any situation.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,2.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,5,2019,48231,False,False

Our expertise is specifically in managing projects for CAD, RMS, JMS, and Mobile solutions.   As NPSG only consults for public safety software, we put a tremendous amount of effort into the research of the providers, how to best procure, and how to best implement these technologies. Our services are very different than what standard public safety consultants offer, as they also offer many other services. They offer a broad range of services, each taking a tremendous amount of knowledge to be great at, such as Land Mobile Radio, Call Premise Equipment, cybersecurity, staffing analyses, consolidation studies, hazardous mitigations studies, building construction, smart cities, on body and in car video, and much more. We solely put all of our focus on public safety software. NPSG also hires team members who have extensive experience in public safety software projects. Most of our team members worked in public safety, and most of our team members worked at a Tier 1 public safety software company, understanding the details of how companies sell, implement, upgrade, and support their solutions. This gives us great insight when working on your project. As a concierge service, we also assign a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for each part of your project. Each project has a product SME for each product (CAD, RMS, JMS, MDS), but you also get a Needs Assessment expert, a Selection expert, a Procurement expert for contract negotiation, as well as a Project Manager, so each part of your project has an expert guiding you through the process. This concierge service takes a large burden off our customers as they work to implement these large complex solutions. We take the burden off agencies directly relating to workload, as we take a lot of work off our agencies during these projects. But we also take the mental burden off of our agencies by thoroughly educating them each step of the way. Our customers know they are making educated choices, not best guess estimates, during these complex projects. When we say that excellent customer service is important to us, we ensure that we are held to that standard. We do that in two ways. One, we offer a cancel anytime clause in our agreement, so if at any time an agency is not happy with our services, they can cancel their agreement with us. Secondly, our reference list is our customer list. Every agency we work with is listed as a reference regardless of what they might say. We do this confidently, knowing that we have provided excellent customer service to them. Please feel free to contact us with questions or to ask for a demonstration of how we provide our services to agencies like yours.",11-50,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,2.0,11-50,Private,,,,,,6,4,2019,46174,False,False

Fundamentally, we believe too many people aren't being paid what they're worth.  It happens for a lot of reasons, but we believe with verified data and and the right support, we can get you the compensation you deserve. Earner helps you get paid fairly. First, we provide a free OfferScore, which is an evaluation of your offer letter (or letters) so you know how the offer measures up.  Most people focus on base and bonus when they look at their offers, but these only make up 70% of your total compensation. We thoroughly assess your PTO policies, 401K retirement plans, health benefits, commuter stipends, and many more to find the true value of your offer.  We build our free OfferScore by comparing your offers to thousands of others from companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, and privately-held startups - then use that data to help you negotiate effectively for a better compensation package. With an OfferScore in hand, we then work with you to build a Gameplan - that's what we call our partnering approach to negotiation.  For a flat fee, we work with you throughout the negotiation process to help you get what you deserve.  The Gameplan lays out an overall approach and specific guidance for every aspect of your negotiation, including likely counter-arguments.  We update the Gameplan as we work with you, so you always have our best advice and the right language to make your case.  If our work together doesn't result in an improved offer, you pay nothing - that's our commitment to seeing you succeed. Earner's mission is to make every professional feel valued and fulfilled by their work, and that can't happen if you're not being paid fairly.

It exists as the primary brand within Needfire LLC, a manufacturer and retailer of candles, artisan goods, and ritual products.  Ethical sourcing is on everyone’s minds - however, few realize how heavy an impact everyday products have on our environment. US retail candle sales are estimated at $3.14 billion annually, and over 1 billion pounds of wax are used in producing candles each year. However, the industry has very little regulation - the majority of the wax material used contributes to deforestation, destruction of native pollinator populations, and relocation of indigenous peoples. Inexpensive candles are often made with toxic materials, such as wicks containing heavy metals and petroleum based waxes such as paraffin.  Our vision is to open up a conversation about the industry, and sell a product that is transparent about sourcing both wholesale and direct to the consumer. Our candles are fun and pop inspired, with the integrity of a farmstand candle.",1-10,1.0,Early Stage Venture,2022-04-27,0.0,Series A,0.0,2.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,2,3,2020,52374,False,False

Funding feature films is a trillion-dollar business with 5 to 10x returns in the first year after the content's release.

As blogging and digital journalism were topics that few people seemed to understand, I became interested in them.  I read everything about blogging, SEO, digital journalism, or Google ranking. My comfort level with giving advice grew over time. Soon after, I was requested to look through their websites. I made a report to look through a site's metrics and give my thoughts on which factors were most likely affecting it. My inbox was full of help requests. Then I started writing for Quora, Reddit, and Offline. Soon, I was in high demand among my friends. For the most part, I was able to pass on this work to others.  My experience includes working with a wide variety of website creators. Working with newbies and small blogs is what I enjoy the most. I have enjoyed working with them.
