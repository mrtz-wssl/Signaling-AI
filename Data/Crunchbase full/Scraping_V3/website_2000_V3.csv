First, traditional SEO services offer optimizing websites as part of a digital marketing strategy. While these can work wonderfully, the client must continue to pay for search engine optimization, or else it will overtime become ineffective, since the client does not know how to keep up with the strategy after the optimization package is no longer being paid for. Second, those individuals that are wise to seek out an SEO teacher are offered group classes where they are taught at a fast pace about general information and are not given the chance to apply teachings to their own website.   Ultimately, your best investment when it comes to SEO is knowledge and a functioning skillset which will allow you to become your own expert. That is why the best SEO training course is one that gives you individual classes and works on your own website with you, based on your goals and needs.   Online Courses with your own SEO teacher  Our service offers a comprehensive one on one SEO training with an expert SEO tutor, who uses a virtual classroom to teach individual lessons that cater to your skillset and needs.

Our 1st in class gene therapy (ET-101) has been engineered to overexpress Caveolin-1, which organizes & regulates synaptic receptors essential for neuromuscular signaling and function. It can treat a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases through precise, targeted overexpression of Caveolin-1 in neurons .

By targeting these proteins which play a central role in the pathology of inflammation and angiogenesis, we can stop tumor growth, spread, and recurrence. Our first indications are neurodegenerative diseases and cancers with high unmet need and high mortality (e.g. ALS and triple negative breast cancer).

A Local is someone from that city who will provide concierge-like services. Each Local can specialize in an aspect of the city and may already have or can create a large network in that area, for example: Culinary, landmarks/history, fitness/health, parties, & others; the user can then choose the type of Local they want.  When starting the app for the first time, a registration screen with two options (Local | Traveler) will appear. If an individual chooses to be a Local, we will run a background check on them, providing an increased level of security and peace of mind to users seeking exotic experiences. After each booking, the Local would receive a 0-5 star rating. The idea is that better Locals get more opportunities and bookings. All users (Travelers and Locals) can post images/videos/reels of the experience and attract exponentially more individuals. Our app gives communities a chance at gentrification: otherwise, unknown regions can attract global attention through our feed features and international marketing. We are currently initiating data collection trials in small municipalities in the north of Brazil to prove this point. Further on, with more tourists visiting smaller communities, the region's economy also gets positively affected, improving the quality of life of thousands and potentially millions.  We solve not one but various problems present in the Tourism and Concierge industries. With our app, it is no longer dangerous, pricey, disconnected, and time-consuming to properly explore a city the way you would like to. It can now be done with a simple click. And along with solving these impediments, we also give people independence, quality, and a chance to be seen.

Almost every company is gathering a lot of data and is looking for professionals who can analyze that data in order to make predictions & generate insights. Companies like Tencent are employing several thousands of data scientists who are using data and building machine learning models in order to generate predictions & make smarter decisions. Unfortunately, the demand for data scientist exceeds the supply. According to McKinsey research, there will be a shortage of 1.25 million data scientists by 2024. Quality data scientists are hard to find and expensive to employ as a single quality data scientist costs about $117,000 per year according to Glassdoor research. The data scientist has to then spend 45% of their time on model building that we believe is a very repetitive & time consuming process. On top of that, organizations that are thinking about building an in-house solution require more than 3.5 million RMB in investment & usually more than 6 months of development.  That is why we’re building mltrons, which is predictive analytics in 5 clicks. We’re are enabling organizations to build and leverage advanced machine learning & deep learning algorithms without ever writing a single line of code or worrying about investing in infrastructure. The users just need to prepare the data and upload it into the application after which they need to tell the system what they want to predict. Then automatically, our AI engine builds the best fit model for their problems and provides them with real-time predictions and insights.  Our AI engine is built on a robust architecture with state of the art algorithms. Our goal is to get companies from raw data to actionable predictions in the fastest way possible. Mltrons Ai engine can be connected to various data sources after which it loads the data, prepares and cleans the data, build hundreds of thousands of combinations of algorithms and then selects the best model for the problem that can be easily deployed in one click, either by using REST API, uploading new data or using our visual prediction.

Experts agree that dogs are naturally pack animals, so even with a loving owner, they are often are missing something when not being able to be around fellow-four legged friends. The new app Woofr makes it easy for owners to link up and arrange doggie fun or even date days, love could be in the air for pooches and people alike! While a dog may be a man (or woman's) best friend, this still doesn't change the fact that their nature, as pack animals, is to want to spend time bonding with fellow canines. Did you know that there are over 500 million pet dogs globally, plus 1 in 5 has a social media account?!! Furthermore many people face the problem of not having access to another dog or dogs for their beloved pet to play and bond with, a solution was definitely needed. Answering the call, is what some are calling the “World's First Doggy Dating App” Woofr, a fun mobile app (‘social petwork’ if you will) that allows users to show off their pets to make connections with other local dog owners and arrange doggy play sessions, that will likely help their pets be more happy and healthy, and who knows, love could be on the cards for the owners too! The app is available for free on iOS and is coming soon on Android. So there may be just a bit of doggy romance or at least new friendships in the air for both hounds and humans. “When it comes to making connections swiping left or right has become an integral part of the dating experience for many people,” commented James Gaubert, from Woofr. “Now we've opened the door for pet people to use the same kind of cool and convenient technology to find BFF's for their beloved pooches, and maybe even a little love for themselves, something which everyone is sure to enjoy and appreciate, Woofr is the dating app that puts hounds first and humans second”. https://apple.co/2Kz1t0O",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,5,2019,53888,False,False

Our chief antenna scientist, Dr. Mohamed S. Sanad, changed the world’s telecommunications trajectory at Nokia in 1994, leading the invention of the first internally embedded mobile phone antennas. Hoping to change the problematic direction of antenna technology growing in size and weight without delivering more efficient signals, Dr. Sanad dedicated the past 15 years to create what we now know as the IINNTENNA- a smaller, cost effective, and monumentally more efficient antenna evolution. With decades of experience, a passion for revolutionary antenna advancement, and his innate concern for humanity at large, Dr. Sanad’s work has tackled even more problems than he initially intended to solve. This technology’s broadband, far-reaching capabilities are vast. In base station applications it eliminates the need for multiple towers in any given area, positively impacting the global landscape, minimizing deforestation, and significantly reducing exposure to radiation from the daily use of our wireless devices. In satellites the IINNTENNA immensely decreases the size and weight of the structure while maximizing efficiency, cost, functionality, and much more. The IINNTENNA’s features can be used with almost any technology, including all LTE, WiFi, and Bluetooth devices, which could lead to a positive chain reaction that will take us into a more health-conscious and environmentally friendly future for all technological advancement.

The company was founded in 2018 by a team of analysts and investment professionals who had formerly worked as part of a development group in a San Francisco angel capital office.  Previously, the team had been tasked with building various in-house data solutions, including one to supply structured XBRL financials to subsidiary Revere Data (later acquired by FACTSET).  It was through this experience that the basis of SDS as a standalone provider was born.   The lightbulb moment for the team came when it moved beyond standard financials (Income Statement/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) and began mining esoteric tables buried in 10K/Qs, such as REIT FFO (Funds From Operations) for a hedge fund manager client.  Although outside of the ordinary workflow, SDS tools easily accomplished the task with a skeleton crew of staff and a microscopic budget (compared to incumbent data purveyors).  At that point, the decision was made to commercialize. Since 2018, SDS has been in stealth mode, quietly improving its semantic parsing engine and its user interface, while preparing for a public launch.  We intend to disrupt a well established and very static industry which currently relies mostly on manual processes to populate databases.  Through automation, our platform improves the efficiency of collecting, maintaining, and updating financial information by an order of magnitude.
