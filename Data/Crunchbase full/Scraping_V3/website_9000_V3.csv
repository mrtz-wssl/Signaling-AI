Millions of couples are sending money back and forth every single day and money is the number one reason relationships fail. Today the process for splitting bills and expenses is manual, time consuming, and can be awkward or tense, plus no one likes doing math. Smoov makes it automatic, accurate and easy. While mirroring consumer behavior of sending money to each other via mobile. How? Smoov integrates with users' existing credit and debit cards and pulls transactions into a private running list.  This creates a very low barrier to entry and eliminates awkward conversations about signing up for a new card together - plus they don't want to do that anyway. Couples set up a default split % for all of their shared expenses that they can adjust on a per transaction basis if they want.  Users swipe which expenses they want to move from their private view to the couples shared view.  Smoov keeps track of the total damage (who owes who how much) and whenever the couple is ready, they can settle up via direct ACH transfer through Smoov. Why?

As a BaaS provider, Whillet handles all licensing requirements, relieving the client of that responsibility.     The fintech solution from Whillet enables across the board installation and support for all processes. This includes websites, apps, marketplaces and other platforms set up for client users, facilitating such things as bank accounts, electronic money accounts and bonus accounts.   Customer wallets can be accessed in a variety of ways, such as via a mobile app or through a website. The embedded finance technology allows clients to substantially increase revenue and improve unit economy indicators.   A good example of how Whillet works is by employing multilevel processing solutions for loyalty programs while, simultaneously, partners get easy management of customized loyalty programs, thereby rewarding regular users with bonuses and real money which they can spend on further purchases.   Multi-billing facilities enable payments to be distributed among all participants in the sales process - the customer, suppliers, store (or site), couriers, and so on. This automated system saves companies time for pursuing more important strategic tasks.   A branded, customized wallet can include any methods of depositing and withdrawing money that the customer chooses. Debit and credit cards, mobile payments, e-money, transfer money providers, and so on. All of the above will be provided as an integrated link in the customer's account.

In other words, having a primary bank is not necessary, thereby eliminating monthly rent charges, overdraft fees, payday loan and check cashing company abuse, and various other fee generating schemes. Utilizing a combination of various Asian ""cashless"" banking systems, like India's UPI, Dapple Pay was created to start a revolution that says, ""People do not need to pay a bank to conduct day to day business."" Dapple Pay is a small Startup created by 2 South Florida Civil Rights Attorneys who wanted to create a way to reduce the Florida's high and often undisclosed Child Support ""tax"" levied on child support payments. As their brainstorming expanded, these former financial services professionals reexamined the available mobile wallets and payment systems and realized that the over 25% of unbanked and underbanked americans, mostly Minorities and Immigrants, needed relief too. Dapple Pay Wallet was born. Upon launch, Dapple Pay will be available in iOS and Android devices. Dapple Pay can be used internationally, and where contactless (NFC) payment consoles are used. Additionally, Dapple Pay will be available in Ecuador, El Salvador, and all other locations where US Dollars are used as primary currency (except for Zimbabwe and all other OFAC banned countries.) Dapple Pay is PCI-DSS Compliant and soon will enable in-App Cannabis Sales transactions. Dapple Pay's Developers are UPI (system used in India) experts.
