Through a diverse inventory acquisition strategy, Certified Cell allows retailers to offer a robust selection of pre-owned cell phone inventory to their customers at competitive prices without having to come out of pocket upfront to carry the selection. As is the case in many brick-and-mortar retail industries, margins are tight for wireless retailers and wireless repair shops, which makes it difficult for those stores to have the excess money available to carry a pre-owned phone inventory. This creates an enormous divide between the total solution they can offer their customer and what their customer needs because there is no better captive audience for a pre-owned phone than someone who just found out their phone is broken beyond repair. One of Certified Cell's device acquisition methods is called Mobilize for Good.

Neither have we and the failures of this antiquated, largely analog system drive cost and pain to both schools and students alike.  With unprecedented pressure on schools today from declining population, rising costs, and increased competition from online alternatives, not to mention Covid, the time has come to disrupt and improve this system with technology.  That's Troove.   Troove shifts the admissions focus from enrollment to graduation, using AI to model the social and academic success markers of every school by engaging the people who have already found the success coveted by every incoming freshman -- the alumni.  Alumni hold the success code for their schools and Troove has created the platform and process to quickly and cost effectively define that code so schools can better assess lasting academic and social fit, admitting the students most likely to graduate, not just enroll.   And by concurrently building a large, diverse, global market of applicants, Troove can then filter that entire pool against the unique success code of every school, finding compelling matches for students and schools alike that were never previously possible.  Troove's applicant pool is far larger than any one school can achieve on its own, increasing access and diversity, and breaking down the geographic barriers experienced by the 97% of schools that fall outside the top tier.  This fundamentally shifts the admissions process from generating as many applications as possible to engaging with highly qualified candidates who understand their fit. This drives cost and process efficiencies across the school value chain as more students come, learn, graduate, and remain engaged for a lifetime with their schools.
