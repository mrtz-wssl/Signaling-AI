A world with new opportunities for people to evolve and enjoy their lives. A new way of working, investing, creating business and opportunities for all sectors. Let me tell you more about our work: Since the inception of blockchain, we have championed its application across all sectors as Codebooster. What started as an experiment that took place exclusively online is now changing industries and transforming the way they work forever. Blockchain technology was first introduced to the world in 2008. It is known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But blockchain offers more. Much more. We believe blockchain can revolutionize data management by decentralizing information storage, increasing process efficiency and, at the same time, ensuring greater security for everything from IoT (Internet of Things) devices to health records, supply chains and even government agencies. That means we have another step to go. Let me give you an example about our work with this new vision: The cannabis industry's transition to using this revolutionary technology has benefited greatly from our work with them by making it possible to conduct transactions at low cost rather than the high cost and risk of using large amounts of cash. This works through a system where data is automatically shared across devices without any human intervention, ultimately leading to transparency within these markets no longer being compromised thanks in large part to their use of distributed ledger technology: the Orion Project, also known as WID Token, is our vision for this industry, and we are already working with our own cryptocurrency, its own payment gateway and DAPP marketplace. My company has been looking at getting rid of its old concept, because didn't reflect how far the technology had come since its inception. That's why we are rebranding, so the community can see us in a new light: a more modern take on how you all have been operating for years and now it's time to step up our game! We want to show the community that we are all in this together. We need each other's help, and there is no better way to show our gratitude than through a rebranding that reflects our new perspective of life as one big ecosystem, made up of industries (Constellations) and groups within each constellation, which reference different processes within the industry that need to be optimized or changed to increase the quality of life in our communities. Say hello to Clusterfy, our new name that will replicate the world we see in front of us. Soon you will be able to visit www.clusterfy.io!
