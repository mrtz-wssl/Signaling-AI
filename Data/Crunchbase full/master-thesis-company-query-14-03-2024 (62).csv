Because of HIPAA, a set of rules and regulations that define how EHR’s should be transferred, none of these systems can communicate with each other seamlessly, and as a consequence most medical records are largely faxed from one provider to another.  This is a huge problem–providers have to spend time outlining faxed records, which in turn leads to the possibility of mistakes being made in the transfer process. Our solution has 3 parts.  First, we facilitate medical record transfers through our secure HIPAA–compliant blockchain system. Then, we allow for patients to give consent to transfer their medical record through our intuitive and easy to use patient account where they can manage and accept requests. Finally, we streamline the request process for providers by automating the patient medical record request system.  This saves the provider time, money, and gives them the ease of mind that the patient's health record smoothly and securely transfers into their system. No more faxing, no more cases of malpractice due to manual data entry, just one simple to use software package that smoothly integrates into the providers workflow.",https://www.facebook.com/Myehr-402177913660274/,"Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Max Gillespie,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company leverages the regulatory advantages of flight training with on demand flights to make private regional air travel convenient and affordable to a mass market. Learn to Fly Air uses an innovative experiential education approach designed to have broad consumer appeal. The problem is regional travel for distances between 100 and 500 miles is painfully inefficient and wasteful of time. Traditional airlines are inconvenient and all forms of private or semi-private air services are prohibitively expensive to most consumers. Learn to Fly Air solves this problem by offering custom air travel and flight instruction in fast, modern, 4 seat, piston powered aircraft. The service maximizes convenience and minimizes door-to-door travel times by utilizing a vast network of 5,000 mostly local airports. Combining custom air travel with flight instruction enables Learn to Fly Air to operate in a low burden and very flexible regulatory environment. Customers take a fun, low stress, and legitimate flight lesson on the way to their destination. Learn to Fly Air’s scalable platform matches customers with planes and instructors at specific locations and times of the customer's choosing.",https://www.facebook.com/Learn-To-Fly-Air-296988684166618/,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Education, Transportation",2,"Elias MurrayMetzger, Jay Oshiro",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,

We will maintain a friendly creative work environment that respects diversity, ideas, and hard work. The timing is right for starting this new venture. The revolution of a new industry is upon us. The area of personal design and fabrication is expanding quickly as technologies advance and more cost effective equipment and materials have come in to the market. Many makers and entrepreneurs across the nation still can not afford even just a few of the necessary tools to meet their needs while almost none can afford the full suite of fabrication software, hardware, and equipment. We aim to provide them with access to a full set of the most relevant and up to date means to create at a fraction of the cost of ownership all while allowing them to run their very business out of our facilities. Joe Higgs, the founder, has worked in software design, hardware, networking, and systems administration for both government and non-government contractors for 20 years, has owned his own small business doing home automation and theater, and he has been a DIY-er and inventor since childhood. He has earned the respect of his colleagues through hard work, dedication, and a determined and positive attitude. Joe and his team have what it takes to make this venture extremely successful.
