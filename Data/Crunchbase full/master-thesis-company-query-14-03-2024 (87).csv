The social good sector is defined as encompassing development assistance, humanitarian relief, and charitable organizations. This sector is the backbone behind the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that nearly all countries in the world have agreed to achieve by 2030. The sector has a worldwide annual turnover of over US $2 trillion. The sector is massively fragmented and extremely inefficient. Despite huge compliance costs it is estimated that 30% of funds get lost due to corruption. Further 10% are paid in bank fees and lost due to exchange rate differences. At the same time, customer acquisition cost (getting individual donors onboard) is often as high as 60%.  Only a small percentage, some have estimated it to be as little as 9% of the money given to charity, reaches the beneficiaries. There is little collaboration between organizations, leading to duplication of efforts, and lost opportunities in achieving savings through economies of scale – savings that have been estimated to be as high as 40%. Organizations are neither reaping the benefit of a network effect, nor achieving collective impact gains. This is leading to donors losing trust in the social good sector, which in turns leads to less funding. With such a high percentage of the money raised for charitable causes being lost in corruption, operational inefficiencies, and banking fees, a solution that increases transparency and improves operational inefficiency, simply by 5-10% creates a massive opportunity for social good organizations to increase their impact with more money being made available to the beneficiaries themselves.  Making the world a better place is a big business that is ripe for disruption, and we want to make the social good sector more efficient, impactful, and inclusive and we can do this in a sustainable manner, in a market that is largely untapped today. We plan to do this by building a common „digital infrastructure“ for the social good sector to operate on top of. This allows us to enable achieve economies of scale, greatly reduce inefficiencies, and improve transparency across the whole sector. This infrastructure provides common services that not only improve current approaches, but also enable new and innovative approaches to dealing with social problems.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Other, Social Impact",4,"Gisli Olafsson, Jason Carlson, Nigel Snoad, Sonja Petursdottir",1-10,1,Seed,2018-09-01,,,,Pre-Seed,,,,Pre-Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Bull Hill Capital,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, we have three boats so they can either rent 1,2, or 3 boats if they are available. From there, the customer will receive an email with a waiver to fill out, along with location directions and helpful instructions. On the day of their rental, they will arrive at the Indian River Marina, along with the rest of their group, where they will be met by one of our staff. Our staff will help them and their group get loaded onto the boat, checked in, and give a safety briefing/instructional overview.

We are diligent, energetic, competitive, and team-centered. We believe our early success as a company revolves around the people we work with and their development. Our team is dynamic, coming from various backgrounds. Our common ground lies in our passion for growth and desire to raise the bar. For that reason, we like to describe our company as a leadership development firm that just happens to do sales. Our success has lead us to be fortunate enough to work with some of the leading telecommunications, solar, energy, satellite, cable, and internet firms and we’re only growing our client base. People may ask themselves, why do these name brand companies want to outsource their marketing? There are numerous reasons but the two ones we find most important are: time and money. In outsourcing their direct marketing team to Catalyst Endeavors, we lower the overhead cost for these firms. They no longer worry about recruiting costs, hiring and onboarding costs, training costs, retaining costs, and sales quotas. Catalyst Endeavors gives them back all the time and energy they would have spent to build their team. Now, instead of worrying about expanding their market share with a skilled and motivated sales team, they get to reinvest their time in building a better and newer product. Why do these companies trust us so much, though? Simple: they have seen our systems and strategies work first-hand and know how systematic our company truly is. We stay up-to-date on product knowledge, training methods, and leadership teachings, and instill our team with the skills to be their best. Instead of focusing our training strictly on getting the sale, we teach our people how to communicate effectively, actively listen, and assess the situation quickly with a level-head. Our goal as a company is to develop leaders who will impact their community. By shifting our focus on our people, our people shift their focus and look to deliver their best performance every day because they become personally invested in their results.
