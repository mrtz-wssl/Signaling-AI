After saying that for three times in a row, we realized that we desperately need a word to describe it in the most concise way. So we found it - and we now call our product “Seamless VR”. Simple as that.  What is Seamless VR?  Seamless VR is a gateway for one or several players to fully immerse into virtual reality - as deep as the state-of-the art technology only allows it. You move your body as you would in the real world, see your own body and other players, interact with VR objects, shoot the enemies - and have complete freedom of movement within the physical location. No tethers. No motion sickness. Just the lightweight portable gear - and the regular walls you might want to avoid bumping into. Bottom line: Seamless VR allows you to interact with the virtual world the same way you would interact with the real world.

USEFUZE was designed by an owner of a small painting business and is the best app for: - Painters - Landscapers - Handymen - Carpenters - Contractors - Roofers - Plumbers - Pressure Washers - Electricians - Woodworkers - Driveway Pavers - HVAC - Renovators/Remodelers - Builders - Side hustlers - + Hundreds more – What other contractors are saying? - As a mother of two and the office manager in our family’s small business, USEFUZE has saved me the most important thing: time. I am able to get our estimates, invoices and expense tracking done in half the time, giving me more time with my family. - The best feature of USEFUZE for me is the digital business card. In a second I can share my info, before/after photos of my work and customer reviews with potential customers in a professional format, and it has already helped increase my business. - When I’m trying to concentrate on actually doing the work that I love to do, USEFUZE helps me handle all the digital things that aren’t necessarily my skill set. - When I am at someone’s house doing an estimate, I can text or email the estimate directly to them and get a “Yes” before I even leave their house. - When I share my digital business card with customers, they are immediately impressed with all the past customer reviews, pictures of my work and how organized and professional I appear. I’ve never been more confident that they are going to call me for an estimate. - I’ve sent out invoices and estimates in the mail that never reached my customers and lost so much time tracking down old invoices at the end of the year that I don’t even want to know how much money I’ve lost. With USEFUZE, all of my invoices are easy to organize and keep track of without even having to think about it. - I love doing painting work as a side hustle but I hated doing the paperwork and constantly communicating with customers. With USEFUZE I am starting to enjoy my side hustle again and I’m making more money! - I handed out an old business card to someone at the store and it was so crinkled from being in my wallet they couldn’t even read it. I went home and immediately started looking for digital business cards online. Most digital business cards only let you put your contact info but with USEFUZE you can add customer ratings and pictures of work. – You and thousands of contractors work hard to earn your money, to grow your customers, and keep up with life’s demands! Contractors, are you frustrated with sending estimates, missing invoices, tracking customer payments, and remembering where those work showcase photos are? How about highlighting a great review for your work from a satisfied customer? Then USEFUZE is the mobile app for you! Benefits: • All your business needs in one app • Free to download and use • Create estimates and invoices • Track income over time • Share your work on social media • Share digital business card directly to customers • Organize all your ongoing and pending jobs • No ads • Secure data and backup. • All on your phone - One app - free - secure!",https://www.facebook.com/USEFUZE,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Rawley Filbin,1-10,1,Seed,2021-01-01,300000,USD,300000,Pre-Seed,300000,USD,300000,Pre-Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,

Clients Our clients include businesses of all sizes, among them many Fortune 500 companies, as well as educators, government agencies, and training and development consultants. Over the years, our hundreds of offerings have been used by millions of individuals in more than 100 countries. Heritage Our story began more than 50 years ago with the pairing of two psychology professors—one from Stanford and one from U.C. Berkeley—with a common goal: to use research-based psychological assessments to give people the insight and guidance they need to develop in both their personal and professional lives. Their partnership resulted in the creation of CPP, Inc., the company formerly known as Consulting Psychologists Press. Honoring Dr. Harrison Gough (1921-2014) On May 4th, 2014, we lost one of our founding fathers, Harrison G. Gough, PhD. Dr. Gough leaves behind a remarkable legacy of dedication, kindness, caring, creativity, and, of course, his many extraordinary contributions to the field of psychology—including the California Psychological Inventory™ (CPI™) assessment. All of us at CPP are honored to carry on his work and his vision to “help millions of people, including our employees, develop themselves.” Myers-Briggs® Assessment But our roots reach even deeper than that. The Myers-Briggs® assessment was first developed in 1943 by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. This mother-and-daughter team were among the most prominent pioneers of personality assessment. In 1975, CPP became the exclusive publisher of the Myers-Briggs instrument. Today, CPP is a world leader in personality, career, and organizational development assessments.

According to a recent poll, more than seventy percent of consumers are conducting their shopping online, even for personal items. Due to society’s introversion, this planted the seed for the innovative application, Deliverable, in which one does not have to leave their home to obtain everyday items, such as groceries, household items, games, furniture, antiques, and miscellaneous item. Big box companies are already speaking with Deliverable to innovate the way we ship.    Solution: Instead of the onerous task of brick and mortar shopping, Deliverable provides a mobile application for consumers to receive items in the same business day or within ninety minutes, without ever having to leave their doorstep. With the click of a few buttons. Like any delivery service, the driver does not have to make contact with the person who receives the item, which limits the interaction to the Covid-19. The delivery driver acts like a post-man, and the item will be left at one’s doorstep without ever coming face-to-face. The entire transaction is completed through cyberspace. Technology: Currently, on Deliverable financial budget, Deliverable has produced an Apple (iPad and iPhone) version of the mobile application, and our next goal is to launch the Android version, but we need more funding in order to continue to make the application accessible for all consumers. In order to promote the application, we need marketing dollars. We would like to make Deliverable a household name. With marketing dollars, we can fund the press releases, commercials, radio broadcasts, referral, SEO, SMM, etc. IP/Defensibility: My intellectual property has a patent, and I have a lawyer on the payroll. My IP is protected by our patent, and Deliverable has a patent-lawyer on speed-dial, Hugh Keefe, Esq.   Competition/Competitive Advantage:  Target, Walmart, and Offerup, each company has already stolen parts of my intellectual patent for their business’s shipping options, and they are offering “same day shipping” on their mobile application. After speaking with my lawyer, Attorney Keefe, each company must cease and desist their “same day shipping” options. If these big-box giants, partner with Deliverable, we will be driving Walmart and Target products to customer’s doorstep. Additionally, on the app, we will stimulate the pricing of products in retail, because there is a follow social feature. When someone delivers something, the price and any info gets posted on a list. When the consumer sees that price they will possibly change their buying methods. Market Size/Customers: The goal for our market size in the United States—we launch the application nationwide. Per state, Deliverable is looking, to begin with, Connecticut and New York. Subsequently, we have five drivers and are currently in a race to get 200, independent contractors, ready on stand-by, in Connecticut as soon as the app launches on Friday. Once the analytic data from Connecticut and New York goes through our Firebase cloud, with your funding we will launch nationwide. Deliverable offers customers a free-delivery, one-time free coupon, upon their registration of the mobile application.  Free delivery is one way for the application to go viral (Uber did the same tactic.) The postal market is very lucrative. If we get one percent of the national postal market, according to pre-COVID-19 numbers in 2018, USPS, FedEx, and UPS deliver over 56 million packages per day which leads to 5,400,000 packages being handled through Deliverable per day. If each delivery transaction is 20$, the daily numbers would be in the millions $108,000,000.  Business Model: The Deliverable business model is very simple: provide an excellent same-day delivery service to everyday consumers, and our goal is to transport as many items as we can per day to the appropriate destination. Also, we need to partner with as many companies as we can, so they can include us as an option at their mobile checkout. Once we are funded, we can open analytic data-centers (one in every two states) to analyze the information to make sure we do not have any downtime. Driver to Consumer collaboration will be made with the separate application that is currently underway. Milestones: As a team, we are launching a mobile application this week. Our first milestone is we found an innovative team of engineers in India, to maintain our budget, who is currently working on finalizing the mobile application.  We fulfilled our quota for drivers in New York and Connecticut. Financial: Deliverable gets paid on a daily basis, and projections are high. As soon as the application launches, I will make sure each driver is compensated for each completed delivery. The driver gets 60% and the company gets 40%. For example, if the delivery is 20$. The driver gets 12$ and we get $8. As soon as the driver completes the delivery, the driver gets paid immediately through the mobile application. Per each state, there will be charging sales tax. There is a standard insurance clause the consumer agrees to when they register for the application. This is how our financial work = $2.99 a mile for a small to mid-size vehicle. $3.49 a mile for a larger car or SUV. Finally, it’s $3.99 to $4.49 depending on whether a truck, flatbed, or freight has to be used.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Information Technology, Software, Transportation",1,William Indocci,11-50,1,Seed,2020-06-02,1000,USD,1000,Seed,1000,USD,1000,Seed,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,4,,,,,,,,,

The system also collects granular data on talent’s responsiveness and on-the-job performance. - The majority world can produce more than just outsourced coders, so we invest in our talent’s own ideas too.
