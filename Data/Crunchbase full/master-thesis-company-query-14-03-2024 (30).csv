If you've ever navigated the maze of a SaaS tool and wished for a quicker way to find answers, or if you're a CSM feeling the weight of endless queries, we see you. We've been there too. We've seen time and again how important it is to service customers quickly, effectively, and accurately. Most businesses struggle to get customers everything they want and need when they ask for it. CSMs spin their wheels with data pulls, engineers that should be working on product have to come up with quick queries, and there's no time to service the long-tail of smaller customers that are all trying to gain value from your business or product. That's where the idea for Locusive was born. Our goal is to create an AI assistant that feels like a guide or concierge for your business. For users, it's about streamlining those moments of ""how do I...?"" and turning them into ""oh, that's how!"". And for the CSMs, it's about filtering out the noise, letting you focus on the deeper, more strategic aspects of your role. We're on a journey to blend technology with a bit of that human touch, making the digital space feel a tad more navigable and friendly.

Its approach is centered around a groundbreaking computing platform that draws inspiration from the natural neural circuitry of the human brain, replicating its information-processing capabilities - the next generation of neuromorphic computing powered by dynamic neural models (liquid time-constant networks, CTRNNs, reservoir models).

We do this by providing companies with a web-based dashboard and using their data to create AI-driven insights and engagement matches with a vetted consultant network. A problem worth solving:  It is hard to understand the health of your business.  Building and scaling a business isn’t easy; most business owners don’t know how to evaluate and benchmark their business comprehensively. It is hard to find and afford deep domain expertise. Even if business owners know where their business could perform better, it's hard to find and afford subject matter experts. Consulting is available, but it isn’t working for small and medium-sized businesses. Large consulting firms need to be within reach for small to mid-sized businesses.  Good fractional advisors are hard to find and come with significant performance risk.   The current online consulting marketplaces are a step forward, but don’t de-risk engaging a consultant.  Our Solution Sobo integrates with a company’s existing cloud-based financial, HR, and CRM applications to build a data profile of the business. We use this data profile to populate a dashboard that provides key metrics and peer benchmarking for company management. This data is also available on an anonymous basis to our vetted network of consultants to perform a brief assessment and recommendation, which we term “Insights.”  These Insights can be done proactively by the consultant at the company's request. Over time, these Insights will migrate to an AI predictive model.
