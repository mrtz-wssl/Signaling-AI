The mission of 1ON1 is to offer search engine optimization training to entrepreneurs, small business owners, marketing professionals, website designers, and other individuals who have a website in a format that can allow them to directly apply lessons to their own businesses and learn based on their own needs and at their own pace.   1ON1 SEO training course was designed by Bruce Jones, an SEO tutor and industry expert who realized that there existed two main flaws with SEO that were inhibiting results. First, traditional SEO services offer optimizing websites as part of a digital marketing strategy. While these can work wonderfully, the client must continue to pay for search engine optimization, or else it will overtime become ineffective, since the client does not know how to keep up with the strategy after the optimization package is no longer being paid for. Second, those individuals that are wise to seek out an SEO teacher are offered group classes where they are taught at a fast pace about general information and are not given the chance to apply teachings to their own website.   Ultimately, your best investment when it comes to SEO is knowledge and a functioning skillset which will allow you to become your own expert. That is why the best SEO training course is one that gives you individual classes and works on your own website with you, based on your goals and needs.   Online Courses with your own SEO teacher  Our service offers a comprehensive one on one SEO training with an expert SEO tutor, who uses a virtual classroom to teach individual lessons that cater to your skillset and needs. Based on your existing knowledge, our SEO teacher will adapt a course on fundamental topics, from keyword research to optimized content writing to Google analytics and more.

Consumers want to immerse themselves in memorable moments, but often crave alternatives to alcohol. Cannabis products have become more popular and a wide variety of new pioneering cannabis-based options continue to change the landscape of nightlife and social gatherings. LOKI blends these consumer trends and offers a completely new way to enjoy the night. A true innovation in drinking. With only a few sips, you can enhance any moment. As knowledge, research, and complexity around the marijuana industry evolves, new discoveries about the active ingredients and their unique characteristics are constantly being discovered. LOKI's unique ingredient is Delta-8-THC, which is one of the lesser-known natural elements of the cannabis plant. It differs from its more commonly known relative Delta-9-THC by a slight variation in molecular structure. Most cannabis users experience the potent effects of Delta-9, as it makes up the majority of the plant's THC presence. However, by using an extraction method, LOKI can take the more isolated and rarer Delta-8 and offer a cleaner overall experience. Delta-8 offers consumers a far lower psychotropic potency, while still giving them the ability to immerse in prolonged and enjoyable moments.

Patients are commonly shocked by their final out-of-pocket costs. This adds to the stress and avoidance many feel when they need care.  At Dentalogic, we make a difference by:          Insurance Verification (IV): Before a patient walks into the office, our team has created an extensive benefit summary of each plan and builds that plan into the office’s practice management system. This allows your dentist to provide each patient with an accurate understanding of the estimated out-of-pocket cost of their dental treatment.          Billing & Collections (RCM): Receiving a detailed summary of each patient’s benefits before a visit only solves part of the issue.

A Local is someone from that city who will provide concierge-like services. Each Local can specialize in an aspect of the city and may already have or can create a large network in that area, for example: Culinary, landmarks/history, fitness/health, parties, & others; the user can then choose the type of Local they want.  When starting the app for the first time, a registration screen with two options (Local | Traveler) will appear. If an individual chooses to be a Local, we will run a background check on them, providing an increased level of security and peace of mind to users seeking exotic experiences. After each booking, the Local would receive a 0-5 star rating. The idea is that better Locals get more opportunities and bookings. All users (Travelers and Locals) can post images/videos/reels of the experience and attract exponentially more individuals. Our app gives communities a chance at gentrification: otherwise, unknown regions can attract global attention through our feed features and international marketing. We are currently initiating data collection trials in small municipalities in the north of Brazil to prove this point. Further on, with more tourists visiting smaller communities, the region's economy also gets positively affected, improving the quality of life of thousands and potentially millions.  We solve not one but various problems present in the Tourism and Concierge industries. With our app, it is no longer dangerous, pricey, disconnected, and time-consuming to properly explore a city the way you would like to. It can now be done with a simple click. And along with solving these impediments, we also give people independence, quality, and a chance to be seen.  Local is by the people, for the people.",,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Software, Travel and Tourism",1,Rui Santoro,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,

Problem: How can we enable people to have fun while competing with their friends? Solution: A gamified mobile app that allows users to compete wagering social clout. Details: Users join groups with their close friends and with affinity categories (specific sports, TV shows, eSports, etc.). They challenge others in their groups to competitions (who can do more pushups, higher score on the test, which team will win, etc.). Friends see these competitions and predict the winner. After reporting the outcome, the winner and those who supported them increase their ranking in relevant groups. Friends also see competition results in newsfeeds and can engage via liking, commenting or sharing.   Features:  ●	Newsfeed: The home screen where users engage with friends’ new competitions, engage with competition results, and are served behavioral nudge advertisements for trending events.   ●	Groups: Users form groups with their close friends and move up and down rankings within the group based on how much they are winning. Larger groups could include LOL stream watchers, NBA Fans, etc.  ●	Trending Events: In addition to user-generated competitions, we have native content that allows users to make predictions on the outcomes of popular sports, live eSports, and TV shows.  ●	AI Invitations: We gear towards virality by allowing users to challenge friends who don’t already have accounts through phone numbers or email and increase conversion with an AI chatbot.  ●	Virality: Millennials have a strong desire to stay updated about their friends' activities. Users often invite their friends because of the focus on groups and friends are very likely to accept invitations for fear of missing out.    Monetization: ●	Native programmatic advertising nudges.  ○	Competitions on events drive direct user engagement (ex. Someone predicting the outcome of a game or tv show is much more likely to watch it). ○	This type of advertising has higher efficacy/engagement than traditional banner ads because it contributes positively to user experience instead of a distraction from it. ●	Influencers: Users can come to our platform to follow the competitions of their favorite celebrities or brands. ●	Data analytics and A/B testing as a service for big brands.
