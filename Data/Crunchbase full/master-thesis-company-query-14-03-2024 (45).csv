Founded by Suzanne Macbale, former Associate VP of Design at Victoria's Secret and Merchandiser at Calvin Klein, whose deep expertise spans design, production, marketing, sales, fittings, and more. LoveSuze was born out of Suzanne's passion for quality lingerie, decades of industry know-how, and one-on-one conversations in fittings to deliver what consumers really want. This manifested into LoveSuze's signature Flex-Sizing®: modern sizing that embraces the natural changes of a woman's body for a perfect fit with every wear. The LoveSuze brand recognizes a woman's body is constantly in flux. All bras, underwear, bodysuits, and slips are made with Flex-Sizing® fabrics that stretch and mold to every unique shape, providing all-day comfort and support. Regardless of age, cup size, waist, pre or post-natal body, LoveSuze pieces are designed for the best fit and flatter, no matter where a woman's weight fluctuates. Focused on modernizing lingerie, LoveSuze bridges the gap between sexiness and comfort; rejecting the idea that the two can't coexist. With LoveSuze, a woman's most comfortable intimates are also her sexiest. Beyond bras and underwear, LoveSuze inspires confidence in all customers—unlike anything else in their dresser.

Many children with dyslexia struggle with traditional learning methods, leading to frustration and poor academic performance. Parents, educators, and dyslexic students often lack access to comprehensive, personalized, and engaging resources to improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. LexBox offers an innovative solution by leveraging AI, machine learning, and gamification to create tailored learning experiences for dyslexic children. The platform also provides progress tracking, expert guidance, and a supportive online community for parents, guardians, and educators.  We're developing an AI-driven, gamified online platform that helps children with a learning disorder (dyslexia) by providing personalized and engaging learning experiences. Our solution leverages AI, machine learning, and gamification techniques to create tailored lessons that target each child's specific needs, helping them improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. In addition to offering customized learning modules, LexBox provides progress tracking and expert guidance for parents, guardians, and educators. By helping to over 2 million children in the U.S. and 60 million worldwide, LexBox aims to empower dyslexic children to excel academically, boost their self-confidence, and build a brighter future. Our platform is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this multi-billion dollar market with a hybrid business model consisting of B2C subscriptions and B2B SaaS offerings.  We learned from our experience that children with dyslexia struggle with traditional learning methods, leading to frustration and poor academic performance. Parents, educators, and dyslexic students often lack access to comprehensive, personalized, and engaging resources to improve reading, memory, and accuracy skills. And most of the companies on the market use the Orton-Gillingham (OG) teaching method (developed in the 1930s).

With the growth of fractional shares (or dollar-based investing) and Robo-advisory, individuals who have $5 here and there can invest in the stock market without investing much. That means the gates to invest in your future are open to everyone! People do not need to make more money to invest. They simply need to pay attention to their current spending habits and understand the future dollar value of their purchases. Nuvestan is a financial visualization tool that helps you be aware of the actual value of your purchases within a given time. Often, we look at a $4 cup of coffee as a small purchase. However, if you buy a cup of coffee three days a week, those purchases add up not only because of the money you spent but the potential money you missed out on in the stock market. Many budgeting websites show you if you have blown through your budget. We take it a step further.
