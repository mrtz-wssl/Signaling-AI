Businesses want to be found by new customers, who need to know accurate locations, hours of operation, and other information about the places they want to visit. Application developers need affordable data without onerous legal restrictions or complicated deal terms. Currently, the best place data is very restrictive, expensive, and controlled by a small handful of companies. Quality varies globally, with data concentrated in the biggest markets and poor coverage elsewhere. Even the highest-quality data isn't fresh enough: who hasn't searched online for a store to find it closed or with different hours? Creating and maintaining a dataset like this is a very difficult problem. Restaurants open and close, a store changes hours, a doctor moves her practice across town, or a public building might close for temporary renovations. The StreetCred team has long experience with open mapping software and data and believes the time is right for a high-quality, permanent, decentralized solution to the place data problem. We are developing a protocol that will incentivize the collection and maintenance of data for the places people care about worldwide. To solve this problem, we need to build a system where anyone can freely participate in appropriate incentives. The data must be open and accessible to anyone who wants to use it.

We provide reliable, portable, affordable sharing power banks all over the world by locating our charging stations (kiosks) in different kind of venues (restaurants, karaokes, nightclubs, bars, etc). Our main business model is collecting revenue from powerbank rentals. Customers can use our App or WeChat to scan the QR code on the kiosks and rent a portable powerbank. The renting price differs among venues. At present, we charge customer $1 for restaurants and $2 for karaokes & nightclubs in New York (Maximum $10 per day). Also, we will profit from advertising business (kiosks, social media and app) in future since we are the first company in shared powerbank industry that has a screen on the kiosks. Our operating areas now cover New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Vancouver and Sydney. Our business is trying to solve the problem that phones are becoming necessary to everyone and people nowadays easily run out of phone battery. We will provide such kind of service that makes customers no longer get anxious about low battery phones. We have more than 15 competitors all around the world now. Most of them are in East Asia/South East Asia since that’s the origin of this type of business and all the products are manufactured there. Except competitors in the US, all other competitors have a similar business model to ours. Some of them got huge investment such as Enmonster/Laidian/Xiaodian in China and ChargeSpot in Hongkong/Japan. Competitors in the US are running a different kind of business model by selling charger or locating phone in a secured box to charge, which is not prevalent in leading market. Our clients can be separated into Consumers and Business entities. For consumers, we targeted on those people who would easily running out of phone battery. According to our research, most phones can only last for less than 8 hours after a one-time charge, which means most people have a demand of charger in the evening.

Sports referees currently rely on antiquated third-party referee schedulers to provide them with games to work. Similarly, sports organizations rely on the same referee schedulers to provide referees that are qualified to officiate their games. This approach has not been updated in decades as the referee industry continues to use outdated technologies and employment methods. The result has been a severe drop in the supply of referees while at the same time demand has increased. Our application, Refr Sports, will modernize the current system, providing referees and sports coordinators an efficient and effective tool for completing their respective duties. Refr Sports makes this a reality by offering a mobile application that supports both referees and sports organizers as end users. Our app delivers complete freedom to the users by allowing the sports organizations to post their game schedules along with officiating needs and offered compensation for each game. Referees can then see the ‘work order’, accept it, and be paid immediately after the game. The Refr platform makes money by taking a small service and processing fee on the payments we facilitate through the app. This business model is very similar to what has been successful in the food (DoorDash), transportation (Uber) and personal care (care.com) industries. Our Refr Team, made up of business, technical and sporting experience, has set out on a mission to create the platform that will turn the referee industry into a gig economy marketplace. The world has seen this successfully materialize in many industries already and the referee industry can be next, by making it easy to post opportunities, claim opportunities, and get paid.",,"Greater Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Software, Sports",2,"Huck Sorock, Wyatt Gustafson",1-10,2,Seed,2023-11-02,120000,USD,120000,Pre-Seed,120000,USD,120000,Pre-Seed,245000,USD,245000,245000,USD,245000,Techstars,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will also introduce a utility token that can be used to purchase the security tokens on our platform. The real estate market has always been a popular investment option, but it's not always accessible to everyone due to high costs and limited options for fractional investment. The rise of blockchain technology and NFTs has opened up new possibilities for fractional ownership of real estate, which is an untapped market with great potential. Our platform will target both experienced and novice investors who are interested in diversifying their investment portfolios and benefiting from the steady growth of the real estate market. GloComX platform will operate as a marketplace that allows property owners to tokenize their real estate assets and sell fractional ownership to investors. We will create security tokens that represent a portion of the property and can be traded on our platform. The security tokens will be backed by the actual real estate asset, and the investors will have ownership rights to the portion of the property represented by the tokens. GloComX  will also introduce a utility token that can be used to purchase the security tokens on our platform. The utility token will have multiple functions, including access to exclusive investment opportunities, discounts on transaction fees, and governance rights on the platform.

Dry eye is the inability of the tear film and lids to protect the surface of the eye, resulting in itching, burning, and pain. With a dozen or more underlying causes, dry eye is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat, and if left untreated, it can lead to permanent corneal damage. Patients with even moderate dry eye can suffer from debilitating symptoms that lead to a drastically reduced quality of life. Current treatment options are limited, and most patients rely on over-the-counter eye drops for temporary relief. But because they neither treat the root cause nor appropriately address the symptoms, current products on the market fail to provide adequate relief and must be reapplied as often as 6-12 times every day. By pairing proven technologies with pioneering research, EternaTear™ is developing a product that is closest to natural tears.

For semiconductor companies and electronic device manufactures with stringent requirements in terms of safety and security, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware provides secure boot, device attestation, remote firmware updates, telemetry, real-time monitoring, and scalable secure communications. Unlike traditional firmware, which is built as a monolithic blob of trusted and untrusted functionality, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware is completely self-contained and isolated from the rest of the system thanks to the underlying Hex Five’s patented MultiZone® TEE technology. With Hex Five, companies throughout the semiconductor value chain benefit from stronger security, reduced development costs, times and risks, and the flexibility to safely integrate readily available multi-sourced hardware and software components. PATENTED TECHNOLOGY Securing embedded devices has become increasingly difficult as complex new requirements are often met with the addition of readily available 3 rd party components that cannot always be trusted. Most embedded devices lack the hardware resources to provide the necessary separation, thus leading to larger attack surface and increased system vulnerability. To shield critical functionality from untrusted third-party components, Hex Five has designed, developed, and patented MultiZone® Security, a truly innovative Trusted Execution Environment providing hardware-enforced software-defined separation of multiple functional domains within the same chip. Complexity is the enemy of security. To simplify the development process, and to minimize the risk for human error, MultiZone encapsulates and hides the complexity of managing the underlying hardware security blocks exposing their functionality as a set of policies. The only interaction between the developer and Hex Five’s Trusted Execution Environment is a simple policy definition file.

The state-of-the-art drug and alcohol testing solution leverages DNA matching technology to validate at home test results by matching  DNA from saliva and urine” “Our goal is to eliminate observed collection from the drug and alcohol testing industry.  It’s stigmatizing and retraumatizing for many clients.
