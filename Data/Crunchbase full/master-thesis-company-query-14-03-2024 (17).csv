Does this conversation sound familiar? I have this problem at ZIP code 39531. Can you fix it, when can you fix it and how much will it cost? Our A.I replies to that request with answers to each part. Example service request: “39531 toilet won’t flush” Example A.I assistant reply: Service Name: Toilet Repair (Won't Flush, Running, Clog) Estimated Price: $85 Soonest Arrival Window: 10/18 Thur, 9:00am-10:00am Click here to order this service Or find similar services here  Hometown Workforce is like DoorDash for services with an A.I assistant that helps consumers hire service providers. These people create a series of service listings on our marketplace. Consumers then pick the service they need, choose an available start time, and deposit 1% of the estimated total down. This 1% contractually obligates the person to show up on time and complete the work for the price estimated. If they don't they risk losing access to the platform.  This order process also runs the person's entire business. It manages payments, provides jobs, and schedules those jobs. All the person has to do is show up on time and do a good job. In exchange for this commitment to being honest and reliable, our tech can turn the skills of virtually anyone regardless of race, gender, background, or circumstances into a successful business. Angie's List and all the other lead gen sites do one thing. They connect consumers with contractors. They can't schedule the job. They can't verify the quality of work and they can't verify the price is fair. Without all 4 you can't effectively help consumers complete jobs. We take care of all 4 and more! MISSION STATEMENT: Our mission is to help eliminate poverty by turning people's skills into successful businesses. This is the first true solution to poverty I'm aware of. It's also perhaps the most powerful tool ever conceived for incentivizing people to be honest and reliable.  HOW OUR TECHNOLOGY WORKS: What makes this platform truly revolutionary is the series of listings people create on our marketplace. These listings pre-price and pre-timed their individual services.  Since each service is pre-priced we can standardize prices which eliminates price gouging, it also ensures the person gets paid.  Since each service is pre-timed the consumer can look at the person's work calendar and see all the available openings with enough hours to accommodate the specific job. Then they pick one which ensures the person shows up on time. It also provides them with jobs and manages every hour of every day. It tells the person where to go, what to do, and when to be there. There are billions of ordinary people who have skills people will pay for. They just have no idea how to turn those skills into a successful business. That’s exactly what Hometown Workforce does! We also have a training division that can provide people with skills. You choose a trade, we partner you with an instructor who will create listings specific to your career path. Consumers order those services and after you learn to do the work on the job. All the listings are turned over to you and instantly you have a successful business.

(DUNS # 074595993) was founded in March 2019 and is dedicated to developing launch solutions and products for the nanosatellite industry. Our business strategy relies on three core components (launch services, cubesat hardware and software) which allow us to provide a true turnkey, end-to-end space utilization solution. Realization of our vision relies on successful development of the Helios cubesat-class launch vehicle. The Helios nanolaunch system is a three-stage vertical launch vehicle with liquid propulsion in the first two stages and a solid propellant third stage. The design utilizes common propellants in the first two stages and a common engine design with nozzles optimized for altitude in a “plug cluster” aerospike configuration. Phoenix utilizes a unique hydrogen peroxide-based hypergolic propellant that eliminates the need for a separate ignition system but also is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and the exhaust products are environmentally-friendly. This propellant family was fully developed and hot-fire qualified by Aphelion Orbitals, Inc. in 2018. We further matured the technology into Aphelion Aerospace's proprietary propellant mixture. The first stage is designed to be reusable using boostback, powered descent and vertical landing. Helios will be completely mobile and not rely on any fixed infrastructure, launch pad or processing facilities. The vehicle will be able to remain fully fueled for hours to days before launch and launch on short notice (2-3 days) after arrival at the launch site. Our launch service provides a number of key competencies: dedicated launch, custom orbital insertion, low cost, and a very short lead time. We target the following use customer types: * Commercial customers desiring rapid, guaranteed launch * Clients requiring a method of deployment and maintaining large nanosatellite constellations for communications, resource identification, and monitoring * Missions demanding specific orbits inaccessible through rideshare * Time-sensitive missions which require quick turnaround to launch * Spacecraft that need to be powered on and/or monitored real-time before deployment * Clients desiring to launch spacecraft with irregular volume and mass envelopes Aphelion Aerospace pursues an innovative launch service business model: * Our launch services are sold in a manner similar to airline ticketing * Regularly scheduled launches are provided to defined orbital inclinations * 30 days from cubesat acceptance to launch * “Gas and go” on-demand capability for dedicated launches on short notice * Full up-front price disclosure and guaranteed",https://www.facebook.com/aphelionaerosp,"Greater Denver Area, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Science and Engineering, Transportation",2,"Matthew Travis, Miguel Ayala",1-10,2,,2022-03-29,150000,USD,150000,Equity Crowdfunding,150000,USD,150000,Equity Crowdfunding,150000,USD,150000,150000,USD,150000,Seldor Capital,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,

Additional conversations with college coaches demonstrated that college football is reliant on an outdated, inefficient recruiting process. Because there are no sources of verified data on high school football statistics, and the pressure to recruit the best class of recruits, programs waste billions of dollars vetting recruits by traveling to areas that they believe have a historical, high density of talented athletes.",https://www.facebook.com/AthlogicInc,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Other, Software, Sports",1,Jacky Levi,1-10,1,Seed,2022-04-18,125000,USD,125000,Pre-Seed,125000,USD,125000,Pre-Seed,125000,USD,125000,125000,USD,125000,Gold-Rep Corp,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,1,,,,,,,,,

We eliminate infrastructure and spread energy loads across the grid to mine more efficiently than the competition, reducing environmental impact and increasing profits. UniCoin has created a new business model and technology for cryptocurrency mining. By using small, fractional spaces in occupied buildings, UniCoin creates a ‘distributed’ datacenter with its MINT mining platform. Our MINT is delivered on a pallet, plugged in to commercial power, and then begins mining immediately. Our model and MINT lets UniCoin scale very quickly- without hassle of construction, hefty leasing commitments, or working with the utility to bring in new lines for HUGE power demand. Instead, we simply install many MINTS in many buildings where the space and power are already available.  This transforms small pieces of real estate all across the country into UniCoin’s collective datacenter, paying the building owner a fee and Unicoin shareholders steady returns. Oh, and our technology uses 40% less energy and comes with no infrastructure build-out costs. Making UniCoin is the most profitable way to mine crypto available today.

Our in-house AI/ML models help us in: - Building individual learning paths. - Optimizing marketing costs. - Deep user database segmentation (psychological, behavioral, and interests based) Customer Problem The main problem we face is the language barrier between peoples. This specifically applies to EU as a multi-lingual community. From other hand the biggest challenge for learning a foreign language is time. Advanced online technologies provide many learning opportunities but all of them require 100% focus for a long period of time which many people do not have. Products & Services To solve this problem, we turned the flashcards that students often use to memorize words into audio flashcards. Over 2000 people say that Worddio is a great tool for learning new words. With Worddio you can learn new words on the move or while doing something else, without touching your phone. Through this method, the learner will also memorize the pronunciation in the correct way, spoken by a native language speaker. We safe students time! Target Market The Worddio app is designed specifically for people learning a foreign language and who don't have time to learn and memorize new words. The Global Online Language Learning Market was valued at $12.49 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $25.73 billion by 2027. With its 34 languages Worddio has potential usefulness for over 90% of the world population. Does it work? We have more than 200K installations and more than 1300 paying users. Business Model - subscriptions: 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, lifetime - up-sales of premium content - advanced flashcards by topics, Audiobooks and Podcasts. - Ads - general or targeted based on user profiles - Apply data & technology to other platforms/apps/fields . . . Developing a B2C model on a global level takes time and resources to break even, but once that happens, the return on investment is maximized at scale. Customer Segments Professionals: adults looking to improve their foreign-language skills for business or career reasons Casual learners: travelers, expats, or other persons wishing to learn a new language or enhance their current knowledge Sector-specific: Service workers, such as call-center staff or healthcare workers, who can perform better with a larger vocabulary and accurate pronunciation. Youth: 12-20 year-olds studying secondary languages in schools Sales & Marketing Strategy We have technology that allows us to build psychological profiles and predict users' behaviours without accessing their sensitive data. We can build bespoke learning paths, custom sales funnels, and target ads. The data gathered allow the pursue of three main objectives: optimzing marketing resources by leveraging predictive machine learning models creating individual learning paths based on users needs upsale of particular content or products Competitors The language learning apps space looks crowded but in fact there is a specific empty niche - passive learning. There are a lot of language learning apps on the market, but none of them use a passive learning method to save time for their users - Worddio is the only one that does. We are opening a new market group to support language learning. The Worddio app is a pseudo-passive learning app powered by AI which saves student time. Competitive Advantage Worddio main advantages are: - our app’s passive learning method  - huge stock of professionally recorded audio-flashcards in 34 languages. - scientific-based approach that leverages ML and AI to optimize costs and improve user experience - premium content section - AI features that will help us deliver the ultimate hands-free experience to our users.",https://www.facebook.com/Worddio,"Greater Philadelphia Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Education, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Ivan Manev,11-50,1,Seed,2021-01-05,250000,USD,250000,Pre-Seed,250000,USD,250000,Pre-Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,"Innovation Capital, Loyal VC",,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-0.09%,17,1,92,,,,,,,,

OUR PHILOSOPHY Information leads to better choices, and choice is power for consumers who want their purchases to reflect their social values. JYBE relies on its users to report back on what types of materials are being used in their food deliveries. We then promote those eateries making Earth-friendly packaging choices. For those restaurants that need some guidance making the transition, we’ll gladly consult on the best choices for their needs. Using JYBE to check which restaurants are most committed to sustainable packaging will help us accelerate the transition to eco-friendly products through consumer demand. Our goal is to educate diners and restaurants alike, and lead a cultural shift just like reusable supermarket shopping bags or the elimination of plastic straws. OUR MISSION TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY In a perfect world, we’d eliminate all single-use items that are harmful to the environment.

We are b2b software for raw material traders In order to produce many of the plastic objects we use in our daily lives in the US alone, 30,000 plastic traders lose 4 to 6 hours of employee work time on messy and tedious operational work.  Why?... Because the deals and shipment process is a mess. We come from the polymer trading industry. When we had to purchase and deliver raw materials for manufacturing, we spent hours on phone calls and meetings, working in excel spreadsheets and sending tons of documents. We tired of it and… We created CommTrade - an intelligent solution that improves productivity by automating, tracking and streamlining workflows between contractors. As results we cut 37% time of work per deal, get 17% more in annual revenue and total control of all business streams. We calculates that we saves over 1 thousand dollars per deal. An average trading company makes over 50 deals monthly. So we can provide monthly savings over 50 thousands for each company. For this we charge 1k dollars in monthly subscription for a basic product and we will go deeply in automation of business.  It is cheaper than big enterprise ERP systems (like SAP and Oracle) Our product is specifically designed for the polymer trading industry based on market expertise. We know which products need to be in this market. And of course we totally boost efficiency than traditional ways of doing business. There are some specifics of the polymers. The market is huge, but very interconnected and we’re focusing on small and medium distributors of plastics. Now after New York acceleration program we are finalizing a pilot with plastic trader and in the next months we will onboard customers form ready pipeline of companies. We want to generate capital of $100k for finishing 8 more pilots in target market and reach over $80k annual revenue.
