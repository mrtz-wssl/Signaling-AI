Our technology provides instant event status delivery and event ownership updates throughout the whole network along with distributed levels of access to functional system modules without cluttering the bandwidth between the nodes. Instead of storing the data directly in the blockchain, Tectum stores hashes that are mapped back to the original data stored at a lower level. This isolates the heavy transaction-related data from the main pipeline by hashing, encrypting and signing the bundles at the end of every transaction and archiving it. This makes the event-related data instantly verifiable and publicly accessible, with different levels of accessibility provided to different transaction-related modules. The event hashing process is run on top of a database in order to enable faster retrieval of data items, and works as an upper functional layer to keep the main-net pipeline free from heavy data processing. The mechanism of isolating the system event formalization process from big-data leading to the main-net unprecedented throughput capabilities is our value proposition. Normally, the rule of thumb for a blockchain is that the greater the security, the slower it is. Conversely, if you want a fast blockchain, you’re going to have security issues, because everything comes with a cost.

We do this by providing companies with a web-based dashboard and using their data to create AI-driven insights and engagement matches with a vetted consultant network. A problem worth solving:  It is hard to understand the health of your business.  Building and scaling a business isn’t easy; most business owners don’t know how to evaluate and benchmark their business comprehensively. It is hard to find and afford deep domain expertise. Even if business owners know where their business could perform better, it's hard to find and afford subject matter experts. Consulting is available, but it isn’t working for small and medium-sized businesses. Large consulting firms need to be within reach for small to mid-sized businesses.  Good fractional advisors are hard to find and come with significant performance risk.   The current online consulting marketplaces are a step forward, but don’t de-risk engaging a consultant.  Our Solution Sobo integrates with a company’s existing cloud-based financial, HR, and CRM applications to build a data profile of the business. We use this data profile to populate a dashboard that provides key metrics and peer benchmarking for company management.

Every player can find a relevant opponent due to global ranking built into the app, a coach that fits all the criteria, a court nearby that he can also pay for immediately, a tennis club with possible registration for ongoing tournaments. The application prototype is now ready and in early January we will launch the first beta version for testing both iOS and Android platforms. Our target markets are Australia, USA, Canada and EU. The launch in the US will take place in September-October 2022. Before that, the app will be tested and will acquire its first users in Russia. There is a big problem in the tennis world right now - we see lots of unqualified coaches who are picking up their racquets and as a result are not teaching their students correctly. We are solving this problem by verifying coaches through KYC. We provide verified coaches with a blue check mark. Coaches themselves will be able to create and fill out their own schedule. After each practice session the client will be able to leave a rating and feedback for the coach. For the integrated tennis courts (initially there will be 55 in partnership with findsport.ru) we are bringing in new clients and facilitating schedule bookings.  For the tennis clubs we are providing an opportunity to sign up new members. Monetization: there is a paid subscription for players since the basic version is free. As for tennis courts and coaches we offer a boost that will place them at the top of the search list. There are also advertising spots within the app. From January 1, 2023 the app will have its own tennis e-commerce platform and branded merchandise.

I had no idea how to get into the space when I started with crypto currency.  After hours of research I fumbled my way into the system and finally bought some Bitcoin, then started trading in other alt coin markets. After I told a friend and spared him the hours of work by guiding him through it, another friend asked me the same thing. I did the same for him, and I ended up teaching a bunch of my friends. They where all curious and wanted to get in, but the process is not intuitive. I made it easy for them and now they are all trading. So, the idea behind this site is to take the pain out of it getting into the crypto currency market space. That’s what inspired me to start this site. Let me and my friends help you and join us helping others as this dynamic marketplace grows and changes. We really do believe it will change world markets.
