Since the start of the pandemic, large companies have began to roll-up all of the small and medium-sized practices in the mental health industry.  This was accelerated by increased demand due to the health crisis, but also the transition from in-person to online care and additional reliance on technology.   This roll-up has put pressure on the existence of small and medium practices, especially those that do not currently accept payment through insurance.  These large companies are afforded the benefits of economies of scale and streamlined relationships with insurance companies.  Without a change in the market, these small and medium-sized businesses will slowly disappear since they cannot compete with these large players. Unify seeks to bring the benefits of a large corporation to small and medium sized mental health practices in the U.S.  This will occur through two principles.  First, through the development of software which can efficiently manage all aspects of a small to medium sized mental health practice.  Current software solutions are not bespoke to the mental health industry, and therefore are not able to operate these practices out of the box.  Second, Unify will manage all aspects of insurance relationships on behalf of the affiliated practices.  This allows Unify to negotiate as a large network on behalf of all affiliated practices instead of a as single smaller entity. Unify has three practices currently working as affiliates, including our in-house brand Meridian Counseling.  We currently have a total of 70 providers with 1150 active patients in both California and Utah.

His wise guidance is the best insurance against stress and failure. From an early age, Kris Bort knew that the financial world was his to conquer. And he has been thriving in this industry from the time he passed the necessary licensing requirements to be a FINRA registered broker. Bort spent almost two decades on Wall Street as a top producer. During that time, he learned all the ins and outs of the financial world, built invaluable connections and made millions for his clients. He mastered the game. He realized that there was a better way to do things. Silicon Valley insiders should not be the only ones allowed to build wealth by allocating capital towards companies that shape the future of America and the world. This has been a closed club of the privileged few for too long. It is time to level the field, let other players in, and change the rules of the game.

Kelp does not naturally grow in the deep ocean because there are no nutrients in the top layer and kelp needs a substrate for attachment. Marine BioEnergy is building unmanned drone submarines to tow long lines of kelp.  The drones will submerge the farms below the thermocline at night where nutrients are abundant and surface the farms during the day to absorb sunlight. The drones will also submerge the farms to avoid ships and storms. In preliminary testing conducted by a team at the University of Southern California Wrigley Institute, the depth-cycled kelp is growing as well or better than the control kelp. If the kelp continues to thrive in the open ocean environment, the next step is to deploy farms to grow kelp as a biomass feedstock. The proof-of-concept experiments are funded by an award from the U.S. Dept of Energy, Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).
