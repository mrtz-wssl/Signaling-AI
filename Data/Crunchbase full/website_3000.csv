This process is also unsafe when you don't have access to clean water to wash the cup. When CapdCup is full, you simply open the cap on the bottom of the cup, which allows its contents to empty. Then, close the cap, and you’re on with your day in a matter of seconds - no removal necessary. CapdCup is a new sustainable period solution designed for modern lifestyles—CapdCup eliminates the pain and time associated with having to remove, empty, and reinsert your cup repeatedly throughout the day.

We have built multiple platforms that provides in-person and web-based tutoring as well as social media connecting services. Our tutoring platform is called Bayise Tutor and the social media platform is named Bayise Social. The platforms can be used together or as separate, standalone apps. Bayise Tutor makes it easier for tutors to conduct in-person and online classes and reach out to more students to enhance their earning potential. At the same time, the platform makes it easier for students to get access to tens of thousands of online tutors in their subjects. Students can find tutors for everything from homework support to subject comprehension in areas where they are struggling. Students can also find support in completing assignments. The Bayise Tutor platform has been in development since 2019. It was recently incorporated in March 2021. We have already signed on dozens of tutors within a short period of time and now looking to expand our services to customers. Once fully operational, we expect hundreds of thousands to millions of students to signup and benefit from the Bayise Tutor platform. Our platform aims to make education easier and non-disruptive for students that have been especially hurt by the ongoing pandemic and cancellation of their classes. Bayise Tutor will make it easier for students and parents to find the best tutors in their area to provide one-on-one and group classes. We are currently in the process of setting up offices that will be used as tutoring centers to accommodate thousands of students. Apart from the tutoring services, we are also building an online social media platform, Bayise Social, that is aimed specifically at students and young people.  Bayise Social will be a big social media platform that will offer advanced social media services such as posting, chatting, commenting, audio call, video call, live stream, group calls, advertising and much more.  The social media platform is available both on mobile apps and as a website. The revenue stream for the business will come as a percentage commission from tutor earnings.
