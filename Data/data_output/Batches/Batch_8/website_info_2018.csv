I believe there are at least three core reasons worth calling 1 First, with the number of high growth and venture backed companies increasing significantly, competition for that top talent is fiercer than ever . Even in the current, cooler market environment, it is still very challenging to hire top talent in many 2 Second, companies are growing their revenues at rates not seen 5 - years In these high growth companies talent is the biggest This means that hitting hiring goals has become mission critical , leading recruiting functions to become more strategic and operationally 3 Third, the pandemic era has accelerated many of these trends . Remote hiring has made talent markets more efficient leading to candidates being matched with more companies at a faster It has also made the logistics of interviewing easier, leading to faster interview loops which has further shortened the time that top tier candidates are Carving a Path to Hiring Excellence As a result excelling at hiring has become a strategic advantage for high growth companies and has led to the rapid maturation of talent functions at Talent leaders now often have a seat at the table when it comes to some of the most strategic decisions businesses face - namely headcount and organizational And for early stage founders the ability to hire well has increasingly become an important criteria investors focus While today is a challenging time for many talent teams we strongly believe that the trends set in motion over the last couple of years are here to And we see a lot of talent teams use this time to prepare for the next wave of The difference between how recruiting was largely done in the past and how the best teams operate today is We’re seeing the best companies making hiring excellence a top While the term hiring excellence lacks a formal definition, we see companies and recruiting teams aim to excel at all of the below (and oftentimes much more!): Candidate experience What is the quality and speed of your candidate communication? How well do they get to know the company and their prospective team during the interview process? Candidate assessment How good are your interviews at predicting job performance and how consistent are you at evaluating candidates? Candidate attraction Are you building enough top of funnel via sourcing activities? Are you generating diverse pipeline? Are you improving your talent brand to make it easier to attract candidates? Are consistently closing strong candidates? Defining and hitting realistic hiring targets Are you able to capacity plan and track progress to goal? Is the recruiting function a true partner to the business in headcount planning? Stakeholder engagement How good are you at sharing metrics out to stakeholders? And how good are you at holding them accountable for their role in the hiring process? Hiring efficiency How many resources do you need to support your hiring goals? How much time is the company spending in interviews for each hire? The list above is certainly not comprehensive, but it shows how the demands on modern recruiting teams Anyone who has never been exposed to an extremely well run recruiting function is surprised just how much goes into achieving hiring The Age of Recruiting Operations To support talent teams in these (largely new) demands more and more teams are building out a recruiting operations function at much earlier stages than used to be Taking a page out of the playbook of teams where Sales and Marketing operations have been well established for many years now, talent teams are focusing dedicated resources on recruiting processes, tools and strategy, knowing that these ",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20220913085729/https://www.ashbyhq.com/', 'timestamp': '20220913085729'}",20220913085729.0,0.0
