Over the last two weeks, nineteen members of the Synthetix community have nominated themselves to be on the Spartan Council, a new component of Synthetix governance, and seven will be voted on successfully for the first Council Epoch, the month of The Council will be responsible for approving proposed changes to the Synthetix Initially, this will only include SCCPs (i.e. configurable changes, such as changing exchange rates or the target ), but the aim is to also include SIPs (i.e. more complex changes to the protocol) in the All of this and more can be explored on the Boardroom Synthetix Hub Hereâs a quick summary of the new framework from Kainâs post : A new Snapshot instance will be created This instance will have an proposal to elect seven council members Voting weight will be based on a users debt at the last fee period Voting weight will be scaled quadratically The seven highest vote weights will be the elected council Council members can be removed via token holders modifying their votes Every three months a new election will be held for the Spartan Council The seven council members will then vote directly on SCCPs under these conditions: One council member one vote If the constitution of the council changes during a proposal it is invalidated if it would have changed the result Proposals require a minimum of three positive votes to pass The minimum proposal length is hours The pDAO can require a revote at its discretion The number of seats can be modified via SCCP To learn more you can read this SIP written by Andy In this effort, the Boardroom team is excited to support the community and the newly elected council members as they look to formalize this process and reach a more efficient deliberation and voting mechanism for SCCP s and in the future, SIPâs: The Boardroom Synthetix Hub Features: A basic governance landing page displaying the nomination proposal, recent and upcoming SCCPs on which council members vote, and the list of current council members or A proposal details page mirror Snapshotâs UI, displaying relevant information, and allowing the user to cast their vote from this same A voter information profile page featuring delegate (or a nomineeâs) information, social links, associated addresses, and a delegation â We feel itâs important that delegates have the tools and information they need to properly represent their constituents, and that SNX token holders remain informed in order to act as an accountability mechanism should the council members deviate from their mandate as community Transparency in information can create a useful balance with managerial efficiency existing alongside community and voter Governing anything, including decentralised protocols, is obviously and within the Synthetix community we have a strong norm of running low risk experiments to attempt to optimise aspects of the system, this proposal is intended to be aligned with that - Kain Warwick We will be collecting all feedback on the Boardroom Discord #Feedback Make sure you also sign up for the Boardroom Product Newsletter to stay up to date with the latest releases and announcements!

T cells are generated in vivo by administering proprietary activated autologous macrophages that activate tumoricidal T Cells, Neutrophils, and Natural Killer Cells whilst curtailing the activity of Tregs, MDSCs, & T cells are generated ex vivo by in vitro expansion of T lymphocytes (TIL). Both in vivo and ex vivo methods result in a polyclonal immune response against multiple tumor The therapy has broad applicability for unmet needs in the treatment of solid Rather than directly targeting tumors through individual , SIRPant generates a , multifaceted immune response against tumors, thereby acting as a cancer This approach targets many antigens resulting in the production of T cells and B cells that lead to SIRPant is synergistic with Radiation Therapy, showcasing complete response and abscopal effects, as well as Immune Checkpoint Blockade, with complete response in L pancreatic and colorectal Check back often for updates on our ongoing research, or contact one of our principals for more information .

Pixlet is the open source version of our internal app development It makes it pretty darn simple to build pixel In our production environment, Pixlet is running 7 behind the scenes to power everything on Tidbyt from stock prices or weather information to tracking the NYCÂ In this guide, I ll walk you through how to build a Bitcoin price What is this thing? Pixlet is a interface that runs and renders Pixlet The scripts are written in a language that s very similar to They can use Pixlet s library of ""widgets"" for laying out and drawing The result of running a script is a GIF or WebP animation, which can be viewed in a browser or ""pushed"" to a Tidbyt device via the Tidbyt Down the road, we hope to fully open up our systems to allow Pixlet apps to be published and made available to other A picture and some code This Bitcoin tracker is fully implemented with It fetches the current price of a Bitcoin (in USD) and displays it on a Tidbyt You might be surprised by how simple the code To get started, let s install Pixlet and make sure you are able to run Check out the installation instructions if you re using If you re on macOSÂ and have Homebrew installed, you should be able to just run: brew install tidbyt tidbyt pixlet Once you have Pixlet installed, create a file named and write a simple Hello World script: load(""render.star"", ""render"") def main(): return ( child = (""Hello, World!"") ) â If you ve installed Pixlet correctly, you should be able to execute this script with: $ pixlet serve --watch Browse to http: localhost:8080 and you should see a ""Hello, World!"" Getting Bitcoin data To get closer to a truly useful app, we ll be pulling in some Bitcoin CoinDesk s Bitcoin Price Index API is free to use and requires no We ll use the http module to retrieve the Pixlet includes several modules from the Starlib This is sort of a standard library for Starlark (the langauge that Pixlet scripts are written in), and it s very handy when building anything but the simplest Update your to get actual Bitcoin data: load(""render.star"", ""render"") load(""http.star"", ""http"") COINDESK_PRICE_URL = ""https: api.coindesk.com v1 bpi currentprice.json"" def main(): rep = (COINDESK_PRICE_URL) if != : fail(""Coindesk request failed with status %d"", ) rate = ()[""bpi""][""USD""][""rate_float""] return ( child = (""BTC: %d USD"" % rate) ) â Save the file and refresh your You should now see the live price of VoilÃ .

From spore to slab, the entire process only takes around ten Our Method Seed Our process starts by seeding gourmet mushrooms into trays filled with a nutrient rich medium to grow Grow The trays are placed into vertical farms that simulate the same conditions that mycelium grows in Harvest In a matter of days, the mycelium is harvested and ready to use as a raw ingredient for meatless Cool, but why is this revolutionary? Historically, fungi is hard to find (See Forager’s Secret) . Mushrooms take a long time to grow and nature is finicky when it comes to creating the ideal conditions for them to (That’s why rare and mushrooms are so expensive!) Our farming method is pretty amazing — and granted we’re biased — not only because it allows us to tap into an ancient organism, which is massively beneficial to our entire ecosystem, and makes mycelium taste like delicious meat, but also because it allows us to unlock nature’s brilliance in a way that’s scalable and By not slaughtering animals or using excess land or engineering nature to do something that’s, well, not in its nature, we’re able to support all life on earth, which is pretty revolutionary when you think about Imagine the Impact Learn about our Ethos Ethos In the News Media Kit Team Careers Partner Blog Contact FAQs Privacy | Terms © Atlast   Atlast 0 Skip to Content About Method MY Super Ingredient Open Menu Close Menu About Method MY Super Ingredient Open Menu Close Menu About Method MY Super Ingredient Ethos In the News Media Kit Team Careers Partner Blog Contact FAQs Privacy | Terms © Atlast   MY Super Ingredient — Atlast 0 Skip to Content About Method MY Super Ingredient Open Menu Close Menu About Method MY Super Ingredient Open Menu Close Menu About Method MY Super Ingredient Mycelium = Mushroom Wanna hear a secret?
