You can find this information and answers to other important questions here . Currently, the Energy Aspect accounts for % of the score, comprised of Indicators for energy data coverage, change, and renewable We don’t have more detail yet on how intensities will be scored, but somewhere within the formula, energy intensity could count toward point Energy use intensity is calculate by dividing the total energy consumed by the total gross floor area and is often normalized by factors like occupancy It gets at the heart of building performance more accurately than just data coverage, change and renewable energy So what does this mean? Well, it probably means that we can expect a drop in scores as scoring becomes more rigorous with these new The GRESB Assessment and scoring model hasn’t seen this much change since , when average scores saw a decrease (for the first and only time). It was also marked by much displeasure throughout the industry, which relies upon GRESB Scores for a number of things, including communicating ESG performance to investors, and generally expects to see scores increase year over year to reflect their improved ESG While we don’t know the precise nature of the changes for , knowing that intensities will be scored does allow us to factor them into strategy this In the Scaler platform, we provide clients with a GRESB dashboard that fully aligns with the Asset level Spreadsheet to streamline reporting and make the Performance Component much easier to We estimate points received for indicators according to the GRESB Scoring model, so that clients have an idea of how they will score long before they In addition, we provide clients with a more rigorous Scaler Score which already takes intensities into account .
