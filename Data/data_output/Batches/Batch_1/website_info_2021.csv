Capture6’s ability to scale is enabled by its business model and technical Accountable & Auditable Many approaches to sequestering carbon rely on complex estimates to determine the amount of carbon This does not make these approaches wrong, but it does mean it is necessary to read the fine print on how the number of tons of carbon captured was In our approach, basic chemistry does the work for us and the amount of CO2 sequestered can be easily determined by the amount of CaCO3 Affordable Addressing climate change is not cheap but is far cheaper than the cost of Capture6’s approach costs less than $70 USD That makes it less costly than most mitigation efforts and vastly less than many economic estimates on the social and economic impact per ton of carbon in the Environmentally responsible Ocean acidification and warming is climate change’s evil As atmospheric CO2 increases, ocean ph and temperature are affected, threatening mass extinction of marine Deposits of CaCO3 work to counteract Concept Video Email: Capture6 is a Public Benefit Corporation Offices: Berkeley, California, USA and Rotorua, NZ Our Approach Take action Career Media © CAPTURE6™ | All Rights Reserved Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions   Contact Us – Capture6 We are rapidly expanding our team!
