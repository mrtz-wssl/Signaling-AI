Is there a way to optimize your cloud spend and dramatically lower it? Here’s a hint: it has nothing to do with negotiating better deals (and bigger commitments) or reminding your developers to turn down unused This post outlines a different approach: by leveraging infrastructure and pairing it with objective reliability data you can pay only for the infrastructure you need to meet user Read on to learn how to save money by setting realistic service level objectives (SLOs), keeping customers happy while also managing your cloud infrastructure One of the key challenges in cloud computing is how to optimize the available cloud resources to handle the demand placed on At the heart of the issue is the simple fact that no one wants an unhappy Underprovisioning may lead to users experiencing an outage when there is a spike in traffic, so we tend to overprovision By applying SLOs to workloads, we can better manage our cloud resources to achieve optimum reliability with minimal waste of Unfortunately, that means we’re often spending too much on infrastructure, paying for overhead in a base footprint that is sized too On the other hand, it can be very difficult to understand the impact on the customer experience of not meeting increasing demand while we take action to scale Let’s explore how two complementary tools together can address this problem: Workloads and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

Bitcoin was invented by a person or group known by the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto around No one knows Satoshi’s identity, and as far as we know, they’ve disap­peared and haven’t been heard from for On Feb , , Satoshi wrote about an early version of Bitcoin on an online forum for cypher­punks , people who work on cryptog­raphy technology and are concerned with individual privacy and Though this isn’t the first official release announce­ment of Bitcoin, it does contain a good summary of Satoshi’s motiva­tions. I’ve devel­oped a new open source P2P e‑cash system called It’s completely decen­tral­ized, with no central server or trusted parties, because every­thing is based on crypto proof instead of […] The root problem with conven­tional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat curren­cies is full of breaches of that Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electron­i­cally, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our Their massive overhead costs make micro­pay­ments impos­sible. A gener­a­tion ago, computer systems had a similar Before strong encryp­tion, users had to rely on password protec­tion to secure their files […] Then strong encryp­tion became avail­able to the masses, and trust was no longer Data could be secured in a way that was physi­cally impos­sible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter It’s time we had the same thing for With e‑currency based on crypto­graphic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and trans­ac­tions effort­less.
