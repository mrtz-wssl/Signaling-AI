Are you repeatedly pitching to unqualified leads? Has wreaked its havoc on your business? All of these reasons, as well as high sales turnover, are all solid reasons as to why youâre not seeing any But in reality, these issues are not directly influencing your demo When we think about the demo conversion rate, we should first and foremost think about what is influencing our demosÂ and what we can do to deliver To help sales teams do so, we wanted to highlight the most common mistakes remote sales teams make during the process and provide new approaches to solve these In this post weâll explore the following five mistakes:Â Lack of product and demo knowledgeÂ Failing to adjust the demo to customerâs needs ..Â at scale Neglecting to validate the value using relevant information Relying on the wrong data to gain visibility into the sales demo processÂ Ignoring demo best practices (there are many of them)Â Lack of Product and Demo Knowledge Based on our teamâs years of experience and dozens of interviews we conducted with leading software companies, we realised that in most companies information is distributed across many different roles and Which in turns means companies create an elaborate onboarding plan, in which new sales representatives sit in dozens of meetings and countless training activities with each department to learn as much as they can until they are pronounced Imagine yourself in your new employeesâ shoes, going through this process and attempting to learn a whole new product, product value proposition and sales Itâs a lot of information, and the method itself isnât incredibly People are likely to forget more than percent of what they learned after only a month! Meaning everything theyâve crammed into their brains during the onboarding process will quickly As managers you can continue fighting the forgetting curve , or you can start looking into emerging remote sales tools that utilize learning Failing to adjust the demo to customerâs needs at scaleÂ A great sales rep understands that a good sales pitch is about the customers and the value rather than about the company or specific So how can you help your team focus on the customer without decreasing sales effectiveness?Â A common mistake most sales managers make is spending a considerable amount of time training new employees on the entire product and asking them to build the demo You wonât let your BDR wing it on every outbound call, so why would you do that with your sales reps? Implementing a sales playbook yields better Itâs best to think of a suggested demo flow that includes a unique product click path and talk track that emphasises a specific set of Â But wonât a playbook conflict with the repâs ability to adjust the demo to the customer? On the contrary, the best sales teams build their demos according to one or more of the following elements: persona, industry, use case and company This allows your reps to immediately adapt to every customer and it is much easier to gain control and to react to customerâs needs when you already have a good value hypothesis in Finally, working with a playbook helps new reps shift their pitch from a product focus to value focus and - for more experienced reps - to break their demo Neglecting to Validate the Value Using Relevant Information Did you know that people are percent more likely to believe you if you use numbers?Â This isnât true, but Iâm guessing you found the statement more reliable because of the Using proven data and statistics is key in remote When I began my career, I was on delivering value during my demos, always answering the question: âwhy should you care about our product?â At a certain point I realized my next jump in sales wouldnât come by improving this particular aspect of my I began researching the psychology behind the sales and quickly understood that one of the principles of persuasion is When you add relevant customer stories, statistics, industry news, and ROI benchmarks to your pitch, you gain credibility and encourage your customer to take this huge leap of faith and purchase your This is not necessarily the most important part of your sales demo, but in many cases it is the most neglected part of sales Relying on the wrong data to gain visibility into the sales demo processÂ Â As a sales manager you collect information about every aspect of the sales process: prospecting, qualification, negotiation and so But do you have data that pro",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210128062129/https://www.demoleap.com/', 'timestamp': '20210128062129'}",20210128062129.0,1.0
