wondering how Collins will change Tech’s option offense and what Yellow Jacket fans can expect to see in the next couple of One thing Tech fans can anticipate is enjoying the play of Quarterback Jordan Yates, a soon to be graduate of Milton High School, is an electrifying prospect that should immediately battle for a chance to play under the new He chose Georgia Tech over Duke and Cincinnati and with a GPA will succeed in the classroom at one of the most challenging institutions in Jordan’s most outstanding performance came on senior night when he scored six touchdowns in the first half of the game but his favorite memory came later that season when he lead Milton to win the state championship as Yates lists his work ethic and attention to detail as factors that separate him from the competition and his favorite athletes, LeBron James and Russell Wilson, are great examples to Through high school Yates was more than just QB1 for His favorite sport is actually basketball and he was also a key member of the relay Jordan comes from a great athletic lineage as his uncle played quarterback at His favorite video game is NCAA and if EA Sports decides to continue that series, Press Sports fans could have the chance to play as Jordan and the Yellow Jackets in the Like many high school football players, Drake is among his favorite artists and who he listens to before games to get fired Something people may not know about Jordan beyond the football field is that he loves to play chess and his superstition on the field is to only put eye black under his left In his own words, Yates loves Press Sports because it is a place to not only keep all of your sports videos but is another platform to get recruited Jordan’s ambitions are to make it to the NFL but he also simply wants

prospect at a young At home, he likes to relax through playing the piano with his best song being “Say You Won’t Let Go” by James Outside of playing the piano, his favorite artist is Alicia Keys and he enjoys watching the TV show “13 Reasons Why” as it is a great reminder to treat all people with respect because you never know what somebody is going through in His favorite class at Charlotte Christian School is Old Testament as he finds comfort in studying the word of God and often refers to Joshua 1:9 “Be strong and courageous do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you ” Calvert’s grandfather introduced him to baseball on the front steps of their home in Queens, New They would play catch together routinely allowing Calvert to develop a deep passion for the game at a young Despite growing up experiencing an incredible amount of success on the field, Calvert still looks back on the time he was able to spend playing catch with his grandfather as his some of his favorite memories in As a member of the highly scouted Team Elite Prime, some of Calvert’s best moments on the field have come over the Most notably in a WWBA elimination game when he went with a go ahead home run late in the Calvert recalls the count being when he took a juicy fastball high and inside making it , “I stepped out thinking he would go to his

The Past When we first started creating games — just me, Luke, and Jeremiah (for without whom, not much of this would be possible) in our rooms at home, we never expected it to grow into anything, especially not into Before our first game, , we had no experience making games at We had no idea what we were doing – and that hasn’t really changed, That’s what makes our investor’s trust in us so special, and why we’re so grateful that they want to join us on our journey towards creating more memorable experiences for Most importantly, we feel the most gratitude towards every single person that has stopped by and played our games in the past – whether you’ve put 1,000+ hours into or you just simply swung by to say hi on . There’s been over ,000,000 million of you that have played Zombs, Spinz and Zombs Royale from over countries – that’s almost all the countries! So, thank you to everyone, especially our very passionate community that I know is eagerly waiting for updates and our next games! In , Zombs Royale was launched and we became one of the Top Most Googled Games !

By , multiplayer games – we mean the instinctively social core you see in certain games this ranges from games that are as basic as and , to , highly games such as Along with this multiplayer core, we will be continuing our belief in a ubiquitous gaming We accidentally stumbled on making Zombs Royale (it was intended to be web only until our players asked for and then PC!). We truly believe that platform and hardware shouldn’t limit access to any form of social Just as how anyone should be able to go to a coffee shop, a zoo, or a theme With that said, we hope to be making our games available on as many platforms and hardware as As for what you guys can expect from us next – we are launching a game titled Fate Arena soon! It will be a Strategic Online Battle Arena game, more commonly known as an “auto-battler,” or “autochess.” It is our twist on the incredibly fun genre that you may have seen We hope to create a social, casual and fun experience for everyone new and experienced with the The page is now live at !

PD‑L2 is a critical regulator of human tumor Pairing it with the known action of the PD‑L1 inhibitor means the platform, at minimum, offers the same blocking function as a PD‑1 Building on that action, we are designing it with effector function, which allows the antibody to kill the immunosuppressive cells in the tumor Additionally, the antibody may also function as a tumor‑specific delivery vehicle and as the base for dual‑specific programs, expanding targeting For design and creation, we partnered with a novel antibody development Through trial and error and multiple rounds of affinity maturation, we developed a novel antibody in which both arms bind with clinically relevant affinities to both PD‑L1 and PD‑L2.

Can’t forget the trip to Honolulu! Games as a Gamer Favorite Games: One of my all time favorite is To the Moon by Freebird Games . To the Moon is not only fun, but also the game which provides me with feeling of comfort, joy and I learned game can be a form of art, and game can provide many different values by playing this This is why I call To the Moon as my all time favorite game although this game has relatively short playing My all time favorite FINDING PARADISE Of course, another Sigmund Series Finding Paradise is another game that I have to When I first played the game, I had to agree that it is very hard to find the sequel better than the until I have reached the ending of the It was more touching than To the Moon ! I can’t wait to play Imposter Factory which is due end of the Favorite Game Studios: My favorite game studio is Blizzard Entertainment . There are exceptions, but most of their games provides the best possible gaming experience within the Fans always wait for the new titles or sequels, and Blizzard always try to satisfy community’s Their craftsmanship making the game, and always trying to communicate with the community is something I admire and expect Ocean Drive to What have you been playing lately?: Assetto Corsa is the game I have been playing with I have always loved cars, and after watching F1: Drive to Survive I couldn’t stop playing this Recently, I have been playing this game with my colleagues at the studio, changing tracks every week, competing the best lap Every time I watch YouTube video of real driving on the track I have been playing on the game, I feel amazed how accurate and realistic the game ASSETO CORSA – The Set Up in the Office I have been also playing Animal Crossing with my kids!

This was a critical moment in my life, where I started to think maybe I can become a game Key Philosophy: Key word for the game development for me is “Culture”.
