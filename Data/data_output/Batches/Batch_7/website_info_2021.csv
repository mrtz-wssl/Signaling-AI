The bacteria cease functioning when available oxygen is consumed or when the surrounding temperature exceeds °F. However, crystal formation persists for a while after the organisms become Also, biocide treatment can be resumed following a BioSqueeze ® since it does not affect the minerals Mineralizing solutions used to form the calcium carbonate are common, widely available, safe These are used as food additives, fertilizers, and agricultural feed Photo Courtesy of Adrienne Phillips Photo Courtesy of Adrienne Phillips The silver bullet for the Oil and Gas industry Solutions for all stakeholders We work with small, , and large operators in several basins throughout North Whether you have one well, or one hundred, we can design solutions that work for all Contact Us Directory Home About How It Works Applications Featured Projects Contact © BioSqueeze ® via Website Design By Valerie Manne Design Menu   BioSqueeze®️ Home About How It Works Applications Featured Projects Blog Contact Home About How It Works Applications Featured Projects Blog Contact Eliminate Sustained Casing Pressure in Producing and end of life (Plug & Abandon) oil and gas wells with BioSqueeze ®.

Silica Hash Vaults Architecture Components System of Smart Contract Oracle and Liquidation Bot Basis Reward Index Specifications Functions: Start a Silica contract Functions: Execute Silica Contract Functions: Settlement Functions: Default Glossary Variables Public Methods Events What is Alkimiya Introduction Alkimiya is a permissionless, protocol for consensus capital Every “consensus producer” (e.g., PoW miners, staking validators) requires continuously expending resources to participate in the mining or staking These resources are either in certain forms of computation (e.g., hashpower) or opportunity costs of liquid assets (e.g., coins staked). The primary motivation for most people to participate in consensus production is to capture the profit margin between block rewards (revenue) and the costs of resources (expense). On most networks, the costs tend to increase over time as competition heats Meanwhile, the revenue is extremely difficult to manage as it involves the fluctuations of coin price, difficulty (or equivalent metric), and network Similar to how traditional commodity producers use financial instruments to hedge against the uncertainties, consensus producers need a way to the return Alkimiya allows any consensus producers to create financial contracts backed by the underlying “consensus resources”. In , Alkimiya will focus primarily on the financial abstractions of Alkimiya has two core products: Silica and Hash Vaults . Silica Silica are commodity swaps between seller and buyer of In a traditional commodities market, a swap is a contract calling for an exchange of payments, on one or more dates, determined by the differences in two In this case, Silica represents a swap between the upfront payment that the buyer agrees to purchase the contract with and the mining rewards produced by the amount of hashpower specified during the contract Due to the nature of Silica, the seller will not receive the payment right Every day the seller delivers the required amount of mining rewards, the seller “earns” a portion of the For example, a miner running s of Ethash pays $2,000 every month for In a bear market where the miner wants to protect against the downside, the miner can issue a N Gh s over days Silica @ 2,000 USDT (N < ). Every day the miner is expected to deliver (N Reward_Per_Gh s_Per_Day) number of ETH, in exchange for a portion of the 2,000 The Basis Reward Index tracks the number of ETH s produced on a given day (see Architecture Overview ). See Specifications section for detailed calculation for the USDT “earn rate”. Hash Vaults Analogous to structured products, Hash Vaults are pools of Silica that contain additional payout In the most simple terms, HashVault can be viewed as a portfolio of It is an umbrella smart contract that holds all the Silica that the Hash Vault Admin has purchased on behalf of the buyers of the Hash The HashVault Admin can be dedicated teams running strategies, or committee members elected by a Users can pool together multiple bilateral contracts and restructure the payout logic into other forms of yield generating assets (e.g. bonds, convertibles, perpetual swap, DAO payouts). Unlike most yield generating products collateralized by a basket of coins, the cash flow of a HashVault is secured by the underlying hashpower, which represents the economic activities accrued on the Similar to Silica, buyers of Hash Vault deposit payments in exchange for VaultTokens that represent the ownership of a corresponding percentage of the rewards held in the Hash Vault at the Architecture Architecture Overview The chart below shows the core components and their main functionalities in Alkimiya Protocol .
