Beg, Borrow, & Steal The Primary Skillset of the Partnership Professional Get a Demo Product About Us Blog Beg, Borrow, & Steal The Primary Skillset of the Partnership Professional by Cody Sunkel on April, Weâre All An easy way to build camaraderie with a fellow partnership professional is to lament over the fact that weâre regularly forced to beg, borrow, and Unlike almost every other modern business function, Partnership Teams lack resources and dedicated enablement tools to help us build and manage our Thus, weâre begging for money and attention, weâre working off of borrowed time, and weâre stealing budget and people from other teams, and usually, this comes with an âI Owe  Iâd go as far as to say that the most important attribute of a partnership professional is the ability to activate project teams and charm them into doing work on our The irony is that % of global trade flows indirectly partnerships and Additionally, % of CEOs say their business model will be unrecognizable within 5 years due to the rise of ecosystems ( Forrester ). So, how do we make sense of the disproportionate importance of the partnership function to the investment allocated towards partnership resources? Execs are starting to believe in partnerships as a value driver for their businesses, but many donât understand the mechanism by which partnerships create value, which makes it hard to get executive sponsorship, and therefore budget, for partnership Most execs still see partnerships as an art - something that requires a special eye, attention to detail, and maybe a hint of luck to create success However, the partnership function is making a shift to a âscience,â where consistent inputs yield consistent The inputs are best practices from the partner community, applied with tools built to serve the partnership function The outcome is measurable As the shift from art to science gains steam, the number of Ecosystem Management companies in Forresterâs Channel Software Tech Stack doubled from to , and the investment into partner ecosystem solutions exceeded $1 billion in ( Jay McBain ). These stats are leading indicators that Partnership Teams are becoming successful pitching to the , and maybe even that weâre starting to see top down directives for Partnership Teams to start automating their Itâs the decade of partnerships and itâs time that partnership teams are seen as first class citizens, which means we need a dedicated tech Partner Fleet takes a big step toward that objective by offering a partner marketplace platform that allows companies to launch a world class, whitelabeled marketplace without requiring engineers or marketers to step away from their day jobs to build a custom If youâd like to see what this new product category is all about, get a demo with our team or request a free trial .

Beg, Borrow, & Steal The Primary Skillset of the Partnership Professional Get a Demo Product About Us Blog Beg, Borrow, & Steal The Primary Skillset of the Partnership Professional by Cody Sunkel on April, Weâre All An easy way to build camaraderie with a fellow partnership professional is to lament over the fact that weâre regularly forced to beg, borrow, and Unlike almost every other modern business function, Partnership Teams lack resources and dedicated enablement tools to help us build and manage our Thus, weâre begging for money and attention, weâre working off of borrowed time, and weâre stealing budget and people from other teams, and usually, this comes with an âI Owe  Iâd go as far as to say that the most important attribute of a partnership professional is the ability to activate project teams and charm them into doing work on our The irony is that % of global trade flows indirectly partnerships and Additionally, % of CEOs say their business model will be unrecognizable within 5 years due to the rise of ecosystems ( Forrester ).

These stats are leading indicators that Partnership Teams are becoming successful pitching to the , and maybe even that weâre starting to see top down directives for Partnership Teams to start automating their Itâs the decade of partnerships and itâs time that partnership teams are seen as first class citizens, which means we need a dedicated tech Partner Fleet takes a big step toward that objective by offering a partner marketplace platform that allows companies to launch a world class, whitelabeled marketplace without requiring engineers or marketers to step away from their day jobs to build a custom If youâd like to see what this new product category is all about, get a demo with our team or request a free trial .

A lithium metal anode will increase volumetric energy density due to its high specific capacity as well as increasing specific energy due to its lower density (0.53 g cm3) when compared to While such improvements can be hard using a lithium metal anode, the main reasons it has not yet been commercialized are: instability of pure lithium metal with organic liquid electrolytes, causing parasitic reactions that result in a high impedance interface, and low coulombic And most importantly, safety issues are associated with lithium metal anode forming dendrites during cycling, leading to unpredictable short A electrolyte separator is the key to the advancement of Lithium metal JES patented glass electrolyte is low cost, suppresses lithium dendrites and is stable in contact with lithium metal and metal oxide cathode It can repeatedly plate and strip lithium ions in a symmetric Lithium Glass Lithium , showing no signs of dendritic shorts or significant degradation in JES glass electrolyte is stable up to enabling the use of current and future high voltage cathode SAFE, DENSE, ROBUST & AFFORDABLE With the glass electrolyte separator, JES’s Lithium metal batteries are safer, denser, less expensive, and more robust than the Lithium Ion batteries on the market The JES batteries have the potential for 2 to 4 times the energy of batteries in the same size and weight The Solid State batteries with the JES separator can also withstand higher and lower voltages than most conventional batteries and are designed for significantly lower than conventional Lithium Ion DEEPER DIVE GET A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE TECHNOLOGIES Read Dendrite Suppressing Electrolyte for Enabling Lithium Metal Anode (PDF) Adrian Grant, Lazbourne Allie, Devon Lyman, Kenechukwu Nwabufoh, Eleston Maxie, Yardlyne Smalley, David Johnson,and Lonnie © The Electrochemical Society (“ECS”).

Sexual Dysfunction Enhancement Sexuality is as much mental as it is Some psychedelic compounds like and are well known to increase arousal and Could psychedelics offer relief to those suffering from sexual dysfunctions and disorders ? Another thread here: the line between ""treating sexual dysfunction"" and ""sexual enhancement"" is a blurry one (see men that don t actually have erectile dysfunction taking Viagra). Many sexual enhancement products (like poppers) are of questionable Could psychedelics offer a safer alternative to current ""sexual enhancement"" drugs? Digital Addiction Internet addiction disorder is a growing problem in the There are anecdotal reports of psychedelics helping break video game addiction, and the science shows that receptor agonists hold promise in treating addictive tendencies . Side Note: Empath Ventures is very interested in any technology that helps us control our digital devices rather than our digital devices controlling Please reach out if you re working on any solution to this Digital Therapeutics Can we achieve psychedelic states without psychedelic drugs? Virtual reality and other digital technologies might allow those who cannot take psychedelic drugs due to health, social or personal reasons to reap the therapeutic benefits of the psychedelic Sex and Gender Specific Psychedelic Therapies Sex and gender differences in mental disorders are among the most stable findings in psychiatry and there is evidence that men and women synthesize serotonin at different rates . It makes sense then that every part of the psychedelic therapy process - the drug, the dosing, and the therapy itself - might be adjusted based on the patient s biological Ethical, Sustainable and Economical Psychedelics Supply Chains Increased demand for psychedelic drugs will put pressure on natural sources of psychedelics like the Sonoran Desert Toad , Peyote Cactus and Ayahausca Vine . Synthetic alternatives can be expensive and the chemical extraction process can have negative environmental impacts . We re interested in startups working to create an ethical, sustainable, and economical psychedelic supply Psychedelics for Longevity and There are several pathways through which psychedelics might impact aging, longevity, lifespan and For one, psychedelics are known to have powerful effects, and inflammation seems to be associated with aging . More generally, serotonin is known to regulate biological and behavioral aging in animal This seems like a promising direction for Integrating Psychedelics with Mainstream Medicine In the future, ""psychedelic medicine"" will be simply known as ""medicine"". To realize this future, we need technologies and services that enable existing healthcare workers to provide psychedelic This could be anything from training programs, to referral networks, to shared spaces for therapy We re interested in anything that makes it easier for doctors to begin offering psychedelic medicine to their Applications of Crypto and Distributed Ledger Technology to Psychedelic Research It can be difficult to get funding for basic scientific Crypto projects like Molecule and VitaDao are creating new models for funding speculative drug research and We also think crypto mechanisms may play a role in enabling large scale, decentralized, clinical trials, in which participants are compensated for their efforts and anonymity is preserved in a way that is not easy with Web2 We are interested in any legitimate application of DLT to funding and scaling psychedelic research - no ""shroomcoin"" meme BS Beyond Psychedelics The psychedelic drugs receiving the most attention at the moment (psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT) are all But there are other hallucinogenic drugs that don t agonize the receptor - and some that do",startup,,nan,0.0
