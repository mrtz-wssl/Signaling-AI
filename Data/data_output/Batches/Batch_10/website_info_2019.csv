Posted on April 5, April 5, by Rocky Here are five keys to success in security operations as they were derived from my interviews with SOC team leaders over the last few While this isn’t intended to be an document, I do believe it is a solid foundation for a healthy cyber defense Bonus: I’ve also listed are some of the major pitfalls that have led many organizations down a very sad and even more costly path in the hopes that others may avoid these altogether and instead focus on the strengths identified here or in the comments and conversations that this article Key Takeaway: “Healthy and maturing SOC teams relentlessly drive towards defined ” First Five “Keys” to Success: The Hire the best, then focus on growing the Invest in people over everything The right people can help you overcome flaws in technology and process if they are properly It takes talent to both attract and retain talent so don’t skimp Don’t be afraid of remote workers, with the right goals it’s very clear how everyone adds When building your team remember that diversity is key here as Hire people that ask questions by You’d be amazed by the team you can build around school teachers and police officers inquisitive and creative people can learn technology and push us to ask better questions about why we do things this We need innovative approaches, better questions, and creative It’s time to branch out past the people we know from previous lives and time to start creating the next generation to push us forw ard! Lesson learned: Having at least 3 stars on your team can help drive the right organizational dynamics and push the team across the board to be better, more collaborative and competitive in healthy Having one or two “stars” tends to drive a more negative sentiment sometimes moving towards dysfunction, whereas three or more seems to drive maturity and more healthy conversations in every Last note: Get used to remote teams, learn to manage them by having the right goals in Automate away the If it can be automated, then do If it is repeated on a daily basis, then automate If analysts are inconsistent in their delivery, then If analysts hate it, automate Basically, there is no reason for repetitive or work in the If you find yourself wanting to hire a junior person to do the tedious work – Automate SOAR can be your friend So can DevOps or any number of other tools and Lesson Learned: Technical solutions exist in many forms, but the path to success is likely not going to be adding layers of people to do the work of Having solid processed defined is the key to Let computers do what they are great at, repetitive activities or actions that require consistency and free up your people to do what they are best at, being creative and solving hard Work towards the strengths of Focus on Intelligent This seems easy enough at the beginning, but we’ve been fighting this battle for the last + years and we as an industry are just now starting to get it Every data source and every field that is available to our analysts must be mapped to a value It’s part of our jobs to make sure that data has value and that the value is articulated, measured and validated each and every Aligning to a detection framework like MITRE ATT&CK in a very specific manner is one key to determining what data must be available and why it has Key Data Sources: Network flow, alerts and session, Endpoint (OS, AV, EDR EPP), File Artifacts, Application and OS Logs, User Auth Access, Threat Intelligence, Mobile, Cloud Infrastructure and Applications, and of course enterprise context is all necessary in today’s In fact, our Survey showed that many of these were the missing pieces in the SOC that analysts would love to have available (if they didn’t already). If your SIEM doesn’t support these data types, find one that See my note about Data Engineering Most common event sources that SOC analysts wish they had avai From the VisibleRisk SOC Analyst Survey Conducted in Feb Lesson Learned : Visibility should also be instrumented in a way to help avoid vendor and or data We must create viable paths to product independence, scale, and A data engineering function that owns data from collection, through ingest and into delivery to external systems has proven highly beneficial in many They tend to leverage Kafka to handle the transport of data to analytic systems and something like Logstash or Apache Nifi to reliably deliver that information to Kafka freeing them from a single vendor and focusing them on long term success!

Lesson learned: Having at least 3 stars on your team can help drive the right organizational dynamics and push the team across the board to be better, more collaborative and competitive in healthy Having one or two “stars” tends to drive a more negative sentiment sometimes moving towards dysfunction, whereas three or more seems to drive maturity and more healthy conversations in every Last note: Get used to remote teams, learn to manage them by having the right goals in Automate away the If it can be automated, then do If it is repeated on a daily basis, then automate If analysts are inconsistent in their delivery, then If analysts hate it, automate Basically, there is no reason for repetitive or work in the If you find yourself wanting to hire a junior person to do the tedious work – Automate SOAR can be your friend So can DevOps or any number of other tools and Lesson Learned: Technical solutions exist in many forms, but the path to success is likely not going to be adding layers of people to do the work of Having solid processed defined is the key to Let computers do what they are great at, repetitive activities or actions that require consistency and free up your people to do what they are best at, being creative and solving hard Work towards the strengths of Focus on Intelligent This seems easy enough at the beginning, but we’ve been fighting this battle for the last + years and we as an industry are just now starting to get it Every data source and every field that is available to our analysts must be mapped to a value It’s part of our jobs to make sure that data has value and that the value is articulated, measured and validated each and every Aligning to a detection framework like MITRE ATT&CK in a very specific manner is one key to determining what data must be available and why it has Key Data Sources: Network flow, alerts and session, Endpoint (OS, AV, EDR EPP), File Artifacts, Application and OS Logs, User Auth Access, Threat Intelligence, Mobile, Cloud Infrastructure and Applications, and of course enterprise context is all necessary in today’s In fact, our Survey showed that many of these were the missing pieces in the SOC that analysts would love to have available (if they didn’t already).
