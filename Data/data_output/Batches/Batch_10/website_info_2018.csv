https://yourbase.io/,19365,crunchbase,"How It Works | YourBase How It Works Team Start for Free How It Works Software projects with numerous tests can take so much time to run that developers turn to their CI system to run their tests for Long feedback times and growing infrastructure costs are not uncommon with projects that have high testing Introducing intelligent test selection By selecting only relevant tests to run per code change, developers are enabled to execute tests locally, get faster feedback on changes, improve cycle times, and have a better quality of Instead of waiting around for tests, developers reclaim more of their time to do what they do Intelligent Test Selection with YourBase YourBase s intelligent test selection technology integrates directly with popular test execution frameworks across multiple languages, so it is naturally installable and already embedded with the test runner in its existing development and CI After installation and an initial test suite run, YourBase gets to work in selecting the minimal number of tests to run to help you maximize on time How test runs are safely skipped Consider the following example: A file containing various methods def capital_case(s): return s[0].upper() + s[1 ] def fib(n): if n <= 1: return n else: return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)) and a test file that defines tests using some of the methods from the file . from methods import capital_case def test_capital_case(): assert capital_case( semaphore ) == Semaphore Upon executing the test file, we can observe that the test test_capital_case relies on a single method from the file , capital_case , but not on the method fib . If we were to make a code change to fib , and the test file again, we should have the same exact outcome as when we ran the test file the first Introducing test dependencies test_capital_case invokes the method capital_case , but does not invoke fib during its Changes to the fib function simply do not affect the outcome of test_capital_case . As a result, we say that fib is not a dependency of the test test_capital_case , whereas capital_case is a dependency of test test_capital_case . Putting test dependencies to work During a test run, YourBase traces the execution path of each During a test s execution, it learns about the various files and methods that get invoked, and then stores information about them as dependencies of that test in what is known as a dependency graph (explained more later). YourBase then uses this graph in order to skip tests whose dependencies were not changed in the code changes, delivering the same test results as running the entire test suite as a The power of this logic is that YourBase Test Selection holds itself to a high degree of correctness, ensuring that, given alignment to its design principles, a developer can have % confidence in the correctness of each test run with YourBase Test YourBase uses this dependency principle over and over again to determine which tests to safely skip per The ""skippability"" of a test is based on whether or not its outcome would stay the same change, as it would In addition, we only skip tests that formerly If a code change affects methods or files that a given test does not depend upon, then running our test suite on that code change should not change the outcome of that And so, that test — if it previously passed — can be safely and robust Despite our simple example of skipping test test_capital_case when only fib is changed, most tests and test suites are not so YourBase Test Selection is robust enough to handle complex dependency analyses for you, automatically determining how code changes affect test executions in a variety of simple to complex dependency We regularly ensure the correctness of our test selection technology across huge production codebase test suites for our Understanding the dependency graph in depth At the center of our technology is the YourBase dependency After installing the library, each test executed by the test runner gets observed by YourBase to generate what is known as a dependency graph . The YourBase dependency graph is responsible for recording and storing information that is used to accelerate subsequent test It is responsible for ensuring a correct build with the most minimal number of test runs At its core, it observes and stores information about test dependencies in order to accelerate subsequent test Using the previous example, the dependency graph for the test file would look something like this: The dependency graph makes it clear that the fib method is not a dependency of the test test_capital_case , whereas the capital_case method and granularity Depending on the language, YourBase offers analysis and or analysis for test Where analysis may not be available, analysis is If changes were made to the file, and analysis was not available, then changes made to any of the methods in the file could trigger a test run of test_capital_case when tests are For Ruby, YourBase supports analysis We found that analysis is not",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20190120080117/https://yourbase.io/', 'timestamp': '20190120080117'}",20190120080117.0,1.0

To account for this, plants must have “spinning reserve”: power generation capacity (usually natural gas turbines) that can deliver power in The challenge the industrial sector is facing in order to fully utilize renewables is that one cannot simply turn on the wind or fire up the In the low carbon future, industry must have dispatchable (“spinning”) electrochemical loads acting as reserves (eLARs) that respond to the power, not the other way This is what our technology Matching production up & down with electricity availability in a matter of minutes, this technology allows manufacturing plants to use intermittent and variable power sources while maintaining a safe production We achieve this by maintaining polarization, recirculation, temperature, ionic gradients, and so forth, at stasis when These require the plants to bleed a small amount of energy - which is very easily provided by minimal storage and or grid Currently, there is no other deployed technology in the world that can safely pair steel, magnesium, titanium, aluminum, chemicals, and silicon with After an electrochemical refit or rebuild with our technology along with customized chemistry modifications, each of these industries will become fully dispatchable and The majority of the industrial sector will be able to bypass the renewable energy storage problem and become renewable energy producers, capitalizing on price opportunity and opening up geographic territories that were inaccessible until Digital Millennium Our advanced software efficiently responds to electricity variability and production + Learn More Our proprietary control and digital monitoring system is inherently built into our intermittency This allows plants to utilize our algorithms to pair with renewables, preserving component lifetimes while improving efficiency and safety by reducing operator After application of our technology across industry, there is a potential for billions of tons of carbon per year to be avoided simply by modernizing industrial facilities with our digital High time for Hydrogen Our",startup,,nan,0.0
