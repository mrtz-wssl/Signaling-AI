Our aircraft have electric motors turning propellers with low tip speeds, resulting in considerably less “Our goal is to make our electric aircraft just as safe as commercial ” Safety : Our goal is to make our electric aircraft just as safe as commercial It is possible to achieve these levels because of the simple design and high Key to driving up safety is eliminating critical parts (A), driving up component reliability (B), and designing safe aerial batteries (C). Critical Parts are any part where the failure could have a catastrophic effect upon the vehicle and they ultimately limit achievable safety levels in As we re designing today, there should be no failure that results in a complete loss of power to the Our aircraft will have no single point of failure that can cause a catastrophic Component reliability should be higher for key electric powertrain There are significantly fewer moving parts in an electric motor than in a gas turbine or piston Batteries will be designed to be tolerant to cell failures (either open circuit or hard shorts that may result in individual cel",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210112184024/https://www.archer.com/', 'timestamp': '20210112184024'}",20210112184024.0,1.0

Given that the vagina is the structural connection between the outside world and some of our most important reproductive organs, the local microbiome has evolved to serve as a critical layer of protection against pathogens entering our While there is a variety of bacteria and fungi that can exist in the vagina, Lactobacillus are the local Lactobacilli ensure that the vaginal environment is inhospitable for potential pathogens in a variety of ways: 1) Producing lactic acid that helps keep the pH low and healthy (ideally between and ) 2) Taking up space on the vaginal wall, preventing other pathogens from being able to thrive 3) Producing bacteriocins, which further inhibit pathogens 4) Keeping inflammation down in the genital When this environment is in an optimal state, it can do amazing A balanced vaginal microbiome can lower your risk for: STIs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, trich, herpes, HPV, and HIV Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Fertility complications like infertility and failed IVF Pregnancy complications like miscarriage, preterm birth, neonatal problems, and preeclampsia Gynecological cancers like ovarian cancer and cervical cancer Cervicitis Toxic Shock Syndrome Are my frequent vaginal infections related to my microbiome? Yes! The viruses, fungi, and bacteria that cause vaginal infections are all part of your When your microbiome is imbalanced, it creates opportunity for these bad microbes to If youâre one of the ~30% of people with vaginas that will get BV this year, that means your vaginal microbiome has a wide variety of bacteria (called dysbiosis) instead of a Lactobacillus bacteria playing the main role in creating that lactic acid On top of that, % of BV cases are asymptomatic, meaning that you might not even know if your vaginal microbiome is imbalanced â but you might still be at risk for infection or other Dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome can catalyze other types of infections as well, such as aerobic vaginitis, yeast infections, cytolytic vaginosis (CV), UTIs, all of which can have frustrating (and confusingly similar) side effects, such as itchiness, abnormal discharge, and One important thing to note: research shows that dysbiosis is more prevalent in Black and Hispanic women, but there is a disappointing lack of research explaining why that is or how we can change More broadly, itâs incredibly frustrating that research on this topic has not been more highly prioritized in medicine overall, given the prevalence of vaginal dysbiosis and its impact on our quality of â¦Go onâ¦ Â We know, we know â we could talk about this for But let us point out a few more things â Â the current methods for treating vaginal infections are as archaic as diagnosing Antibiotics and antifungals are widely used treatments which have high rates of success in the short However, in the long term, theyâre not as great of a solution as you might Â While antibiotics and antifungals kill off the bad bacteria, they also kill off the good ones, rendering the vagina defenseless and highly susceptible to In fact, vaginal infections have some of the highest rates of reinfection, with % of BV patients having a reinfection within 3 months and % of patients taking long term yeast infection treatment having a recurrence within 6 months There have been almost no advancements to improve cure rates for vaginal infections for There is a pressing need for better, more sustainable solutions â and demystifying the microbiome to patients, doctors, and researchers can drastically improve treatment options in this If my vaginal microbiome is so powerful, why havenât I heard of it?

Optionally you can submit: properties , which is a dictionary with any information you d like to add timestamp , a datetime object for when the event If this isn t submitted, it ll be set to the current time For example: posthog . capture ( distinct id , movie played , movie_id : 123 , category : romcom ) or posthog . capture ( distinct id , event = movie played , properties = movie_id : 123 , category : romcom , timestamp = datetime . utcnow ( ) . replace ( tzinfo = tzutc ( ) ) Identify Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things like segment users by these An identify call requires: distinct id which uniquely identifies your user properties with a dict with any key:value pairs For example: posthog . identify ( distinct id , email : dwayne@gmail.com , name : Dwayne Johnson ) The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their Alias To connect whatever a user does before they sign up or log in with what they do after you need to make an alias This will allow you to answer questions like ""Which marketing channels leads to users churning after a month?"" or ""What do users do on our website before signing up?"" In a purely implementation, this means whenever an anonymous user does something, you ll want to send a session ID ( Django , Flask ) with the capture Then, when that users signs up, you want to do an alias call with the session ID and the newly created user The same concept applies for when a user logs If you re using PostHog in the and , doing the identify call in the frontend will be An alias call requires: previous distinct id the unique ID of the user before distinct id the current unique id For example: posthog . alias ( anonymous session id , distinct id ) Feature Flags Note: To use feature flags you must also set a personal_api_key when configuring the integration, as described in the Installation PostHog s Feature Flags allow you to safely deploy and roll back new When using them with one of libraries, you should check if a feature flag is enabled and use the result to toggle functionality on and off in you How to check if a flag is enabled posthog . feature_enabled ( beta-feature , distinct id ) Example Use Case Here s how you might send different users a different version of your homepage, for example: def homepage ( request ) : template = ""new.html"" if posthog . feature_enabled ( new_ui , distinct id ) else ""old.html"" return render_template ( template , request = request ) Note: Feature flags are persistent for users across Read more about feature",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210110105102/https://posthog.com/', 'timestamp': '20210110105102'}",20210110105102.0,1.0
