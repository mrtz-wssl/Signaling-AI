https://tabular.io/,22371,crunchbase,"Iceberg FileIO: Cloud Native Tables Tabular blog about jobs team contact Iceberg FileIO: Cloud Native Tables Daniel Weeks Thursday, Dec , Over the past few months, we’ve been asked a lot of questions about Iceberg FileIO like “does it support Azure or Google Cloud?” or “why not use S3AFileSystem from Hadoop?”. Based on those conversations, there appears to be a fair amount of confusion around what FileIO is and what role it plays with various storage providers and processing This is a great opportunity to dive a little deeper into the internal design of Iceberg and clarify how it differs from legacy approaches to interfacing with the storage What is FileIO? FileIO is the primary interface between the core Iceberg library and underlying I frequently say that it is just two operations: open for read and open for That is oversimplified but captures how straightforward the interface Iceberg makes this possible because it has a fundamentally different architecture from legacy approaches to managing Why do we need FileIO? Distributed processing has advanced from an engineering challenge to the foundation for whole data platforms and ecosystems over the last In parallel came the transition from the data center and distributed storage in systems like HDFS to cloud based storage like AWS These shifts exposed the shortcomings of the legacy pairing of storage and compute Operations in the cloud (like listing) are expensive, slow, and in some cases inconsistent depending on the guarantees of the storage This is compounded by the traditional hierarchical pathing and partition structures being the inverse of optimal layouts for the key space in systems like While object stores can handle immense amounts of data and requests, legacy approaches to data management strain many systems to the point of failure (at least from the client perspective). File system directories also cause problems in that the layout mutates as compute When a job is committing data, rename operations are not atomic as a In the cloud, some implementations of rename are not atomic at all and split into two operations: copy and This means there is no real isolation between readers and writers of While it might be possible to avoid conflicts by carefully scheduling workflows to avoid collisions inconsistency, it is error prone and fails to address the ever increasing parallel workloads and ad hoc analytics File Systems in Distrbuted Processing In order to understand how Iceberg addresses numerous challenges that exist in many distributed processing systems, it helps to recognize that distributed storage and processing evolved This close relationship naturally resulted in leveraging the storage layer to solve a series of problems that presented in the processing We’ll take a look at two such Dataset Layout and Task Planning The first case is related to how data has traditionally been organized by This makes sense in the context of building storage and processing Early data collection was often rather messy and inconsistent while processing was handcrafted code compiled directly against the MapReduce This put a lot of responsibility on job authors to parse and understand the data as it existed in the storage layer (hence path based addressing and ). Different datasets were placed under different paths and hierarchies where contextual data in the path was commonly used as physical partitioning to reduce how much data would be read by a single Datasets in this model are defined by the physical file layout and processing data relies on listing directories to discover the input files for a As the processing space evolved, layers were added on top of the file system to further abstract this The Hive metastore brought a logical abstraction allowing datasets to be referenced by name, but did not address the physical pathing and partitioning (pathing is still surfaced explicitly as columns in a table schema). The file system remained an essential component and played the same central Committing Data The second case is related to how distributed processing jobs produce data and the role the file system plays in that For processing to be both distributed and reliable, two properties are required: execution needs to be broken down into tasks that process data in parallel and each task must be idempotent to support retries and speculative Again, the file system comes into play in that each task attempt writes a file and leverages a conditional rename in the file system layer to deconflict competing In both of these cases, the file system plays a critical role in terms of defining the dataset and providing locking mechanisms for concurrency and conflict In the context of processing a large amount of data in isolation, these mechanisms work to an extent and have underpinned distributed processing for over a Unfortunately, these mechanisms break down as distributed processing requirements grow in scale complexity, are adapted to new ecosystems (e.g. infrastructure), an",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20211224173643/http://tabular.io/', 'timestamp': '20211224173643'}",20211224173643.0,1.0
