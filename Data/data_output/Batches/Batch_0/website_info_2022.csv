A virtual machine is a piece of software that can run Specifically, the virtual machine executes smart contracts for a Why do we use the Solana VM? The Solana (Sealevel) virtual machine is a highly parallelized runtime that is constantly For EVM blockchains such as Ethereum or Optimism, at any given point there is only a single program (This is called ""single-threaded."") For the Solana VM, if you have multiple cores, you can run several programs at the exact same time, substantially increasing Moreover, the execution layer continues to improve: Seahorse Lang lets you write Solana VM programs in Soon the Solana VM will support Move bytecode The Solana VM has a fee market coming What is a rollup? Is Eclipse an optimistic or rollup? For comparison, a Layer 1 blockchain is a blockchain that does not depend on any other chain for Layer 1 blockchains require that the majority of voting power is A rollup is a type of scaling solution that executes transactions outside of any Layer 1 and later posts the data to a Layer 1 For an optimistic rollup , a ""sequencer"" executes transactions and posts the result to a Layer 1 along with a A ""verifier"" can the transactions, and if it disagrees on the result, the verifier can challenge the sequencer via a ""settlement "" If the verifier is correct, the sequencer loses their bounty and the bounty is awarded to the For a rollup , sequencers execute transactions and generate a ""validity proof"" (evidence) that they executed the transactions Sequencers must provide this validity proof to the settlement layer for their work to be The validity proof is typically expensive to Eclipse is deploying as an optimistic rollup, but we are working on a rollup in What is a modular rollup? A normal rollup executes transactions but uses the same base layer for settlement, consensus, and data That s a simple design, but it s not good because that base layer is likely not the right choice for all of those A modular rollup separates the functions of a blockchain: (i) execution, (ii) settlement, and (iii) consensus & data In Eclipse s vision for the future of rollups, you could pick any execution layer (ex: EVM, SVM, or Move), choose the right data availability layer for your needs (ex: Ethereum, Celestia, or Amazon Web Services), and settlement could occur somewhere else What is a data availability layer? This question requires some additional A full node in a blockchain network downloads all blocks (transactions) and executes A light node doesn t do that, but a data availability layer enables the light node to efficiently verify that blocks are available to all full nodes on the Data availability is important because storing huge amounts of data limits how decentralized and scalable a blockchain can It would not be possible to build a decentralized Solana VM rollup without this critical Most chains today don t provide data availability because they aren t designed for Celestia, Polygon Avail, and EigenLayer are all data availability layers, and danksharding will bring data availability sampling to Ethereum in the What is a settlement layer? Full nodes every transaction and determine the current state of the What happens when these full nodes disagree? In general, the blockchain will For a blockchain where the majority of nodes are honest, the ""fork choice rule"" will dictate that the correct chain is whatever the honest nodes For a rollup that does not make the assumption that the majority of nodes are honest, the majority of actors might be As a blockchain user (light node), how do we determine which is the correct fork?
