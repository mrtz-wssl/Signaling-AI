Our proprietary technology eliminates two thirds of the steps that are required to make FDCA from food, resulting in dramatically reduced production costs that will enable market penetration for In addition to favorable economics, we make it possible to produce FDCA with negative All other technologies Food Use food as the raw material • Increase demand for cropland • Extreme process complexity • High cost • FDCA PEF Plastics Learn about PEF s applications⬇ Our technology CO 2 Inedible Biomass • Uses inedible biomass and CO 2 • No land use changes • Low complexity • Low cost Applications PEF offers sustainability and performance for packaging and textiles Cartons Bottles Films Trays Pouches Textiles ​ FDCA can also be used to make plasticizers Sustainability Our technology has many environmental benefits process Increased Less Plastic Usage No greenhouse gas emissions from land use change Less food waste No impact on ecosystems & biodiversity Team Aanindeeta Banerjee, PhD & CEO Amy Frankhouser, PhD VP Chemistry Matt Kanan, PhD Interested in joining the team?
