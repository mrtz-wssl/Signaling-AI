Home Technology What It Does How It Works How It Compares Rocket Science Expert Validation Projects Lancaster Global Expansion Track Record Economics Cost Comparison Market Demand Results Reducing Carbon Eliminating Waste About SGH2 Team Partners News Scroll TECHNOLOGY WHAT OUR GAME CHANGING TECHNOLOGY DOES Our patented Solena Plasma Enhanced Gasification (SPEG) technology produces greener than green hydrogen from any kind of waste – from paper to plastics, tires to Our technology changes the game, and the world, by solving two global crises: climate change and waste Affordable, , green hydrogen is the missing link needed to decarbonize the world – with the power and potential to remove or reduce carbon from sectors like heavy transport, shipping, steel and cement, and reduce the use of natural gas throughout our global To date, hydrogen has been an industrial captive, but it is now emerging as a commodity that can be traded, opening capital market access, and unleashing tremendous HOW IT WORKS SGH2’s unique gasification process uses a thermal catalytic conversion process optimized with In the gasification island’s chamber, plasma torches generate such high temperatures (3500º-4000º C), that the waste feedstock disintegrates into its molecular compounds, without combustion ash or toxic fly As the gases exit the chamber, the molecules bound into a very high quality biosyngas free of tar, soot and heavy The syngas then goes through a Pressure Swing Absorber system resulting in hydrogen at % purity as required for use in Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell Our process extracts all carbon from the waste feedstock, removes all particulates and acid gases, and produces no toxins or The end result is high purity hydrogen and a small amount of biogenic carbon dioxide, which is not additive to greenhouse gas SPEG TECHNOLOGY EXPLAINED WHY PLASMA Plasma technology is based on a principle of When energy is applied, matter changes its state: solids become liquids, liquids become With more energy applied, gas becomes ionized and turns into an energy rich plasma state, the fourth state of A plasma torch produces a direct flow of plasma that reaches temperatures between and When that flow comes into contact with solid materials like plastic and metals, it changes important properties of that Using a plasma torch, combined with % oxygen enriched air, our process produces a high quality syngas without any of the toxic byproducts produced by other gasification SGH2 PLASMA TORCH HOW IT COMPARES Ours is greener than green Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has found that for every ton of hydrogen produced, our process displaces to tons of carbon That’s to tons more carbon dioxide avoided than other green hydrogen production processes, which rely on electrolysis from renewable Traditional green hydrogen made from electrolysis is very expensive to produce and requires tremendous amounts of renewable power, which is intermittent, and water, which is a scarce global Unlike other green hydrogen, our greener than green hydrogen does not require a high electrical energy Electrolysis requires KWh to produce 1 kg of hydrogen from 8 gallons of deionized Our facilities generate their own power (1.8 Kwh per Kg of hydrogen) and do not require external power input to convert waste to Blue, gray and brown hydrogen producers either use fossil fuels (natural gas or coal), or low temperature gasification (<2000º C) to produce dirty syngas with low hydrogen and toxic OUR HYDROGEN: MORE CARBON REDUCTIONS, LESS COST Our greener than green hydrogen is 5 to 7 times cheaper than green hydrogen, and cost competitive with the dirtiest Our production costs (based on current US costs) are projected to be US$2 per kg of green Brown hydrogen produced from cheap coal in India costs US$2 per Blue hydrogen — produced from natural gas paired with carbon capture and storage — costs between US$5 to 7 per kg in the US, and $7 to in Europe and Green hydrogen produced through electrolysis using renewable power costs US$10 to per kg, depending on Gray hydrogen produced with cheap, fracked natural gas costs US$2 per kg in
