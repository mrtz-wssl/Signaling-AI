USA adults have coronary artery disease (CAD) 2 people with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) people suffer a new or recurrent stroke 1 Worldwide people have atherosclerotic CV disease in the 7 major markets (US + EU4 + UK + Japan) deaths each year due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease problem While highly effective as an antithrombotic treatment, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is associated with an increased risk of bleeding 1 . As a result, physicians struggle with a dilemma: which patients have a high enough risk of acute coronary events, such that the risk of bleeding is outweighed by the benefit of the antithrombotic therapy? We want to help simplify this learn how this problem impacts patients learn how this problem impact doctors solution Schneider in the Schneider in the We are developing a novel predictive test that is the first to measure FcyRIIa, a biomarker found on the surface of Many tests available today look at the reactivity of platelets to antithrombotic drugs like aspirin or clopidogrel, to assess A large analyzed the predictive ability of nearly such tests across more than studies 3 . The consensus? There remains a need to develop predictive biomarkers that can much more effectively guide individualized therapy for patients with cardiovascular At Prolocor, we are developing a novel test based on FcyRIIa, a protein expressed on the surface of platelets, the blood cells that are involved in thrombosis or clot formation . Most importantly, the expression of FcyRIIa is significantly increased in certain patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular In those patients, we see a significantly increased risk of subsequent CV events, compared to patients without a corresponding increase in FcyRIIa This dichotomy has enabled us to leverage FcyRIIa as a predictive biomarker for cardiovascular patients Our hope is that the FcyRIIa test will benefit the treatment of two groups of cardiovascular “Patients at low risk should benefit from shortened treatment with more powerful antiplatelet ” Resulting in reduced bleeding Resulting in reduced recurrent thrombotic “Patients at high risk should derive greater absolute benefit from long term treatment with more powerful antiplatelet ” doctors Our hope is that the FcyRIIa test will help physicians solve the dilemma: which patients have a high enough risk of acute coronary events, such that the risk of bleeding is outweighed by the benefit of the antithrombotic therapy? references Virani SS, et Heart disease and stroke statistics—2020 update: a report from the American Heart 141:e139–e596.

This goal is executed by combining computational to efficiently make medicines, with a unique business strategy to make sure that we have the freedom to pursue medicines that matter and sell those medicines at a price that the world can Our computational engineering technologies were made possible by the emerging field of computational immunology, and developed by pioneers of that field over the course of 8 From our unique vantage point as the creators of these technologies, we were able to see that the true consequence of computational immunoengineering went far beyond disrupting the biologics discovery services market, and had broken open pathways to victory against many of the major outstanding druggability challenges in our generation of At heart, the technologies we had created were uniquely suited to targeting rare or challenging epitopes on polymorphic These technologies include a generalized (i.e. “universal”) vaccine technology, a influenza vaccine therapeutic candidate (i.e “universal flu shot”), multiple computationally optimized biologics libraries for generating and optimizing antibodies (i.e. “rational bnAbs”), VHHs (i.e. nanbodies), bispecifics and To ensure that we make the medicines that matter, and that those medicines can reach all the people who need them, central to Centivax’s DNA is a commitment to making all of our medicines available at close to cost in the developing world, and to run a lean business that keeps our medicines We enable this by continuing the Distributed Bio strategy of a business plan that grows reluctantly and strategically based on actual business need, minimizes reliance on venture funding to avoid incentive misalignments, partner with grant sources that share our commitment to providing subsidized medicines internationally, and always focuses on rapid product creation as a means of ensuring a sustainable R&D budget while reducing our reliance on any external funding and ensuring that our incentives are always aligned with making medicines that A note from Founding Partner, CEO & President Jacob Glanville, PhD : I grew up in Tzutujile village of Santiago Atitlan on the edge of Lake Atitlan in the Mayan highlands of There was no hospital, and resources were limited due to the ongoing civil war as well as centuries of Santiago didn’t have the fundamental civil sanitation systems or medical support that my American friends take for Growing up, I was infected with amoebas, and giardia, and worms, and other common pathogens so many times I have lost Comparatively, I was lucky: I could afford the Many of the children in the village weren’t so Many had bloated bellies, a red tinge to their hair, and stunted growth: the hallmarks of chronic pathogen burden and Missing medicines, simple medicines, could have changed many When I moved to the United States at , I was at first struck by how most people were much taller and in general took for granted their comparative good health compared to our way of life in the developing As I returned year after year to Santiago, to visit family and to carry out the four years of vaccine studies that ultimately proved the Centivax vaccine technologies, I was delighted to see how much medicine had improved after the war, and how people’s lives had improved with Tzutujile teenagers were a head taller than their parents and older People were spending the time and the resources that they used to spend on illnesses now on bettering themselves, their families, and their These observations have left me with the conviction that pathogen burden, from the microcosm of a single child to the macrocosm of all humanity, is an avoidable waste of human Some medicines just need to reach their final destination, and others need to be invented, but ultimately what happened in Santiago should happen Reducing and eliminating the global burden of disease is one of the single greatest steps that humanity can undertake to liberate our resources and creative energies to better The Posada de Santiago Sign up with your email address to receive news and First Name Last Name Email Address Sign Up Thank you!
