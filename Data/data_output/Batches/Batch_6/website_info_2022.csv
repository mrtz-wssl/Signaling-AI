https://www.sovereign.xyz,5186,crunchbase,"Learn Learn About Blog twitter discord github Community Rollup Basics What Is a Rollup? A rollup is a blockchain that derives some of its security from another blockchain called a d ata availability layer . Just like traditional blockchains, rollups can support myriad use cases - including tokens, NFTs, and smart But, compared with other kinds of blockchains, rollups are much cheaper to Why are Rollups Cheap to Operate? In a traditional blockchain, the work of applying each transaction to the ledger is duplicated across a globally distributed network of computers called full nodes . The larger this network is, the more secure the But, since every full node has to process every transaction, the throughput of the chain needs to stay relatively Otherwise, the cost of running a full node will increase, which will discourage users from running nodes and weaken the chainâs To avoid this issue, rollups donât require most of their nodes to process transactions at Instead, they outsource transaction processing to a few beefy computers called sequencers . These sequencers accept transactions from users and apply them to the rollupâs ledger in real Every few minutes, the sequencers checkpoint the rollup ledger onto the data availability layer (the underlying blockchain) by submitting a cryptographic commitment to the rollupâs latest When this happens, the rollup nodes verify that the new commitment is valid - either by checking a cryptographic proof or by waiting to see if anyone disputes the (Rollups that rely on cryptographic proofs of validity are called zk - rollups , while rollups that rely on honest parties to dispute invalid updates are called optimistic ) Since verifying a commitment is a lot less work than validating the transactions directly, rollups can process many more transactions than traditional blockchains without sacrificing What is the Internet of Rollups? The internet of rollups is what we call a fleet of running on an optimized data availability layer like Celestia or Ethereum (after ). Sovereign Labs is building software to create native connections between rollups - so that sending transactions between rollups feels less like âbridgingâ between separate blockchains and more like making a regular Thanks to the power of cryptography, transactions can be fast, cheap, and secure, with no need for trusted third parties or What is the Sovereign SDK? The Sovereign SDK is a free and toolkit for building that is currently under At a high level, the Sovereign SDK aims to do three First, it will provide a standard interface that allows rollups to communicate with data availability This standard interface will make it easy for rollups to deploy on new data availability layers - and for new chains to support existing Second, it will integrate with cryptographic Developers will be able to write their code in standard programming languages, and the SDK will automatically convert their business logic into a form thatâs cryptographically Finally, it will provide default implementations of common blockchain primitives like tokens, NFTs, and What Use Cases will the Internet of Rollups Enable? The internet of rollups will be able to do everything blockchains can do today - payments, DeFi, NFTs, and governance - but at much greater scale and lower cost than the blockchains of We also expect it to enable emerging use cases, like gaming and automatic bug And, of course, it will allow for new inventions that we canât predict - applications which are only viable at the massive scale and low cost that About Join the Team Read the Blog © Sovereign All Rights Reserved   About Learn About Blog twitter Discord Github Community Make scaling simple We believe blockchains should support billions of users without sacrificing Access for developers in all corners Scaling should be To get there, zero knowledge has to be accessible to developers without a PhD in cryptography, and rollups has to be accessible to developers who arenât expert protocol With Sovereign SDK, it finally will The Sovereign SDK will always be free and open source, and we are committed to engineering every part of the stack for maximum Backers Haun Maven11 Robot Ventures Plain Text Balaji Srinivasan Dean Eigenmann Efe Bulduk Eric Wall Greg Markou James Parillio James Prestwich Joe Lallouz Jon Charbonneau Larry Sukernik Mikerah Mustafa Nick White Sreeram Kannan Tim Beiko Advisors Ekram Ahmed Jonny Rhea Will Villanueva Zaki Manian Learn More Join the Team Read the Blog © Sovereign All Rights Reserved   Sovereign Learn About Blog twitter discord github Community The internet of rollups An ecosystem of seamlessly interoperable and scalable rollups that can run on any blockchain Learn About Sovereign Interoperate Seamlessly Leverage proof aggregation to be a part of a mesh connection of all rollups that are on the same DA Single proof No Bridge the right Scale without Sacrifice Take advantage of components for and advances in Gain blazing Measure",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20230129020450/https://www.sovereign.xyz/', 'timestamp': '20230129020450'}",20230129020450.0,1.0
