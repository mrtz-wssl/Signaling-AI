Pioneering Science In , the first substantial purification of human acid ceramidase was accomplished by Edward Schuchman’s team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York The purified enzyme was found to be an ~50 kDa polypeptide comprised of α and The availability of the highly purified enzyme led to the isolation of the cDNA and gene encoding AC ( ASAH1 ), the identification of the first mutations causing Farber disease, and the production of recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC). Schuchman went on to demonstrate that skin fibroblasts from patients with Farber disease showed significant reduction of ceramide when exposed to Importantly, in a mouse model of Farber disease exhibiting a very severe phenotype that results in early death, injected rhAC was able to reduce levels of ceramide and inflammation in the blood and in the affected tissues and organs, with an excellent safety Schuchman serves on Aceragen’s Scientific Advisory The Therapeutic Based on these exciting developments, Aceragen is engaged in the clinical development of (rhAC).

Artificial intelligence has been applied to analysis of various types of human health Machine learning and deep learning both fall under the broader category of artificial However, levels of complexity differentiate the two Machine learning involves more basic functions, while deep learning is a more complex form of machine learning that creates models from the available data (Wang & Preininger, ). Subscribe Close Machine Learning A review of the extant literature consistently demonstrates that one of the more accurate means of interpreting electroencephalogram (EEG) data appears to be the support vector machine (SVM) model, which is a type of machine learning (e.g., Li et , Mahato & Paul, Mumtaz et , ). Of note, research that examined methods of EEG analysisbetween and corroborated this This study found that virtually all types of machine learning models have been utilized to interpret EEGs, and further, supervised learning methods such as SVM and (KNN) were most accurate (Hosseini et , ). Challenges to Model Development Support vector machine model Offers greater diagnostic accuracy Her main problem: Offers greater diagnostic accuracy Utilizing deep learning: Way to minimize the amount of human intervention needed to analyze data Unlike other types of data, interpreting EEGs presents unique challenges due to the continuous nature of brain waves as well as the large amount of data Therefore, additional steps are required before accurate interpretation can occur, including denoising and Another concern in developing accurate predictive models involves measurement error from physical Contributors to noise on EEGs include equipment interference, motor movements and eye Among the mother wavelet functions tested, coif3 was found to be most effective in addressing these types of noise (Alkareem Alyasseri, ). Diagnosis Use of artificial intelligence to develop a second opinion for the purpose of assisting clinicians in diagnostic Subscribe The depression diagnosis index Category of automated computer diagnosis that assists clinicians in using EEGs to diagnose The depression diagnosis index proposed by Archarya and colleagues combines multiple nonlinear features into one numerical score that translates to an objective diagnosis (Archarya et , ). However, due to the current state of development of EEG technology, the depression diagnosis index may also be considered diagnosis, as human clinical judgment may be necessary to fully describe depressive disorder features and Close Neuroscience Software The Role of Neuroscience for Software Without the use of computer software, EEGs are difficult to Computer–aided diagnosis (CAD) facilitates integration of both linear and nonlinear methods of interpreting EEGs into initial detection of depression as well as confirming human diagnostic In addition to improving patient quality of life, the end goal of this product is ultimately to significantly reduce suicide as one of the outcomes of Neuroscience Software aims to provide a technical solution to facilitate the ability of clinicians to facilitate the ability of clinicians to diagnose accurately and provide timely treatment, as well as monitor response to This will be accomplished through analysis of both linear and The software will integrate with a number of existing EEG measurement devices to analyze biomarkers and provide a depression diagnosis index on a scale ranging from 1 to , in which 1 indicates low probability of depression and indicates high Referenses learn more Archarya, , Sudarshan, , Adeli, , Santhosh, , Koh, , Puthankatti, , & Adeli, (2015a).
