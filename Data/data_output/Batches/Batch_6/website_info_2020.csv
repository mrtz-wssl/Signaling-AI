Each side contains a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) stack consisting of a membrane and porous electrodes on the top and The membranes separate regions that contain hydrogen (H 2 ) gas with different pressures, and they are permeable to protons (H + ) but are largely impermeable to H 2 The bottom region contains high pressure and the top region contains low During operation, H 2 gas on the hot (right) side of the device is oxidized in the region, and the resulting H + ions travel through the membrane and are reduced to H 2 at the pressure This is a spontaneous process driven by the pressure Simultaneously, the reaction is driven in reverse at the (left) side: the H 2 gas is oxidized in the region, and the resulting H + ions travel through the membrane and are reduced to H 2 at the This process is not spontaneous, but some of the voltage produced on the hot side is used to drive this process at the cold The reason this device is able to operate is because the voltage (Voc) produced at the side is greater than that required to drive the reaction in reverse at the Thus, the device operates by continuously moving the hydrogen gas from high to low pressure and back again, while the excess electrical energy produced during this process can be used to do useful The device uses highly reversible electrochemical reactions and a temperature differential to pressurize gas, which can result in efficient conversion of thermal to electrical When used in reverse - it uses electrical energy for highly efficient air conditioning and refrigeration The device uses electrochemical reactions at different temperatures and pressures to create a potential difference, which can be harnessed to drive electrical It has the potential to generate electricity more efficiently than any device in use The JTEC operates in a closed, sealed environment it does not need fuel It is scalable it can be made small enough to harness body heat and power a wearable device, or large enough to capture waste heat from an industrial factory and convert it to usable It has distinct advantages over other devices: Solid State The JTEC has no moving parts, making it easier and less expensive to maintain than traditional Stirling Uses Electrochemical Reactions It uses electrochemical reactions to move and pressurize Other electrochemical converters, such as metal thermo electrochemical converters, employ similar concepts but use liquid sodium or potassium metal, which are highly Operates in a Wide Temperature Range It operates in greater temperature ranges than traditional electrochemical The January issue of Applied Energy Materials features a closer look at the JTEC technology: Fei Huang, Andrew Pingitore, Tedric Campbell, Andrew Knight, David Johnson, Lonnie Johnson, and Brian A Thermoelectrochemical Converter Using Polybenzimidazole (PBI) Membranes for Harvesting Heat ACS Applied Energy Materials 3 (1), DOI: acsaem.9b01830 A Thermoelectrochemical Converter Using Polybenzimidazole (PBI) Membranes for Harvesting Heat Energy To meet the rising energy demand and efficiently utilize a larger amount of waste heat energy from various devices and systems, here we report an innovative hermoelectrochemical converter which utilizes the electrochemical potential of a hydrogen pressure differential applied across a proton conductive The amount of energy available to the external load is the difference in electrical potential between that generated during a expansion stage and that required during a compression In this work, various phosphoric acid (PA)-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes, , , and m p-PBI, are prepared via the poly(phosphoric acid) (PPA) process and investigated to understand how the membrane chemistry affected device When operating a laboratory scale device at °C 200 °C and a pressure ratio of , exhibited the best performance (maximum current density of mA cm 2 , peak power density of mW cm 2 , and net efficiency of %) as compared with the other two PBIs due to its high proton Further increases in temperature or pressure differentials are expected to significantly improve the device All the reported results are consistent with the Nernst equation and thus further confirm the working principle of the thermoelectric conversion This transformational approach may allow for efficient generation of electricity from many diverse forms of waste READ THE FULL ARTICLE The JTEC offers highly efficient energy production in nearly any application where a heat or pressure differential is Farms The JTEC has the potential to be the most efficient device to convert solar thermal energy ",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20201223144223/https://jtecenergy.com/', 'timestamp': '20201223144223'}",20201223144223.0,1.0

Save % on your year! My dear fellow Hero: This is 👋 I hope you and your family are doing Today I’m excited to give you an update on our Heroic social training platform and invite you to become one of our Founding More on that in a First, I’d like to quickly recap the last six months and then look forward to our official launch on April , (Less than days away!! 🚀) As you may recall, on December , , we sent this letter out to our Optimize community letting them know about our plans to create a new business called Heroic Public Benefit We shared our (ambitious) goal to make history as the first company to ever raise $5M via the new Reg CF equity crowdfunding regulations as part of our (even more ambitious) mission to change the course of history by creating a social training platform that would empower us all to be the best, most Heroic versions of Within hours we received support for OVER $5M from our Even now as I type that I get goosebumps and feeling the extraordinarily humbling and inspiring support we have been blessed to 🙇‍♂️ 🙏 (Note: After recommitting to my Heroic Sacred Vow, I reread a page of notes from our Founding Investors on why they were excited to invest (check out a sample here ) and I get tears in my eyes as I’m so moved by your belief in me and in our 🙇‍♂️ 🙏) Here’s a sample of the notes I read this morning: The simple answer is that the world desperately needs a change and Heroic is poised to be one of the defining catalysts of our age to realize Because the world is going crazy and I’d like to do something about This initiative is the one I’ve been waiting for, a community of heroes aimed at helping each other and the world I would love to join this journey! And, for curious souls, here’s my Sacred Vow… Long story a little shorter… A few months later, on March , , with the support of over 2,500 (!) Heroic Founding Investors from over (!) countries, we officially made history as the first company to ever close a $5M Reg CF equity crowdfunding as part of our $11M Seed round of After all that fun, it was time to get to work actually BUILDING our Heroic As you may know, we partnered with MetaLab, the company that built Slack, Uber Eats, and the app for Elon Musk’s new business, They’re We’re officially launching Heroic on April , With the support of Thrive Digital—the marketing firm behind companies like MasterClass, Snapchat, and Lululemon—we’re excited to see how quickly we can serve 1 million Now… We were going to wait until the Heroic platform was actually built before we started allowing people to sign up and then we thought… Why wait? 🤠 Let’s give people the chance to join our movement NOW and then share all the work over the next ten months so we can create some massive momentum and launch HEROICALLY And… Let’s generate some powerful cash flow NOW that we can immediately put right back into our product development so we can launch with an even more powerful platform on Day 1!!! Having said all that… Before we get to the official early invitation, now would probably be a good time to tell you more about what the social training platform will actually be like, eh? 🤓 The platform that trains heroes At the highest level, I’ve always loved this slide from MetaLab’s original pitch deck as it beautifully captures the vision… Then there’s this slide from our original pitch deck: As we’ve wrapped our brains around how to bring the vision to life in an app, we added this little distinction to that slide to capture the power of helping people move from theory to practice together: Then we created this rough overview of Basic Training for the theory side of things along with the “jobs” the app will need you to do so we can fulfill the primary Then our Head Coach, Michael, created this little sketch flow of what the app will need to do: Then MetaLab took that and created this Information Architecture overview to help start refining exactly what we’ll And they shared this look at how it will all fit together: And… Until we have some actual prototypes to show you, perhaps the easiest way to capture the essence of the app is to share the script for the welcome video I’ll be filming We’ll get to that after one more share from Quick context: In June, we kicked off a Heroic branding initiative with two, meetings with MetaLab’s head branding It was 😲 In fact, after the first day, Jana from our team said that the Q&A portion of our first session was “The best podcast I’ve ever listened ” (Goosebumps.) Frankly, when I get on a bit of a roll, I don’t even remember what I 😂 But, I knew I was kinda on 🔥 (hah) as Matt’s questions were so good (👏 ) and the team echoed Jana’s sentiments, so we asked the MetaLab team if we could share",startup,,nan,0.0
