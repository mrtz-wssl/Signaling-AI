Access Request Early Access Toggle navigation Home About Us Careers Blog Request Early Access Tecton: The Data Platform for Machine Learning Posted by Mike Del Balso on April , | Featured Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on linkedin Today, Jeremy Hermann, Kevin Stumpf and I are excited to introduce Tecton, the company we founded just over a year Tecton’s mission is to make it easy and safe to put machine learning into production to power smart product This means bringing the best practices of machine learning development to everyone, and enabling every team to build with the speed, trust, and power of the industry’s most capable applied ML Our founding team met at Uber, where we created Michelangelo , the internal platform for building, deploying, and managing ML systems in We worked with dozens of teams tackling hundreds of business problems with ML, from user experiences like ETA prediction to operational decisions like fraud Across these efforts, we kept seeing the same pattern: data science teams would build promising offline prototypes, but would end up taking months (or quarters) of with engineering to actually get things fully “operationalized” and launched in Michelangelo addressed these problems with its integrated feature store and model management The platform connected a collaborative development environment with production infrastructure, enabling a Cambrian explosion of ML at Uber, where thousands of models and feature pipelines now run in We’ve since heard from countless companies across a variety of verticals, and they all reference the same familiar pains with deploying Some tech companies have developed custom internal solutions after wrestling with these problems for For everyone else, powering customer experiences in production with ML is still an extremely complex, expensive, and often insurmountable Most of that complexity originates in the data layer for ML (feature engineering, sharing, serving, monitoring, and much more), an area underserved by today’s ML That’s why we’re building Tecton, to make operational ML achievable for every Tecton is an data platform specifically built for ML, expanding on the ideas behind Michelangelo’s feature It accelerates and standardizes the data workflows that support the development and deployment of ML The goal is to improve , increase ROI on ML efforts, and fundamentally change how ML is developed within data science Making machine learning operational Machine learning has definitively left the lab and is now transforming how we develop software and what that software can It’s starting to power new customer experiences across nearly every industry, from predicting the availability of hospital beds to matching players of similar skill in online For problems like recommendations, pricing, personalized search, fraud detection, and supply chain optimization, ML is bringing step function improvements that weren’t possible with traditional These examples represent operational uses of ML, which is new terrain for most software Many teams have experience with offline, analytical uses of ML, which enable human through answering questions, generating insights, and exploring In contrast, with what we’ve begun to call “operational ML,” the goal is to enable machine Operational ML drives systems that make automated decisions in the product to power the customer experience, at scale and in Operational ML systems need to be and fully These systems have production SLAs, and make predictions at low latency (<100ms) and high They need to be thoroughly vetted to be trusted to drive the customer They often require integration with multiple software components and collaboration across several development Operational ML use cases need decisions now, not in a report next Dynamic prices, risk decisions, smart responses, and personalized experiences need to be generated and delivered in These models don’t have the luxury of time to wait for complete or corrected If something goes wrong, there’s no time to investigate and debug, so additional business logic (edge case handling, graceful degradation, ) needs to be deployed with the Operational ML use cases are and affect the bottom The product use cases that require ML tend to be and directly tied to revenue or cost Performance issues have direct business The behavior of these models drive the behavior of your Problems here mean costly mistakes and embarrassing customer Operational ML represents uncharted territory for most Teams that haven’t historically been “machine learning teams” are now asked to deploy and manage ML in Teams that produce analytics or insights are now asked to integrate those insights in the product Teams that have historically defined system behavior with rules engines or other logic are asked to replace it with These changes are happen",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20200428195020/https://tecton.ai/',

Patient Centered Approach Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is created through the union of two technologies: ALA tumor targeting and focused ultrasound (FUS) ALA SDT uses an focused ultrasound (MRGFUS) device together with a drug, aminolevulinic acid (ALA), to provide a therapeutic We have compelling data from three independent groups (including SonALAsense’s founding CEO CMO, Stuart Marcus) in three animal brain tumor models demonstrating 70% brain tumor regression and significant extension of survival without damage to surrounding normal brain Both ALA and the MRGFUS device have been shown to be safe and in the brain as they are individually for other indications, allowing SonALAsense to begin a Phase 0 2 clinical trial in rGBM with no additional animal brain tumor model studies Our goal is to turn glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from a deadly cancer into a manageable disease, turning GBM patients into cancer Metabolic Targeting of GBM GBM cells have a unique metabolic signature different from normal brain cells, causing them to absorb large quantities of the drug aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and to convert it to a fluorescent molecule called protoporphyrin which neurosurgeons use as a visual aid to help them remove the GBM during surgery: Blue Light image — GBM glowing pink Courtesy of Nader Sanai, Ivy Brain Tumor Center In addition to creating fluorescence, protoporphyrin can be “activated” by high energies of light in a process called ALA photodynamic therapy (PDT), which activates oxygen molecules in the cell and causes cell While ALA PDT is and used as topical therapy every day by dermatologists for skin (actinic keratoses), it has also been used experimentally to treat However, the process for treating GBM with ALA PDT is invasive and difficult to Fortunately, we and others have found that focused ultrasound (MRGFUS) can activate essentially the same process as ALA PDT and have developed it in animal models for that purpose the process using MRGFUS instead of light to activate protoporphyrin is called sonodynamic therapy (SDT).
