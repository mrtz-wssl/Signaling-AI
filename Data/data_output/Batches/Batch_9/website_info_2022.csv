It’s all thanks to the Stackable Battery Bussing Management has indicated that with a small amount of modifications to the enclosure, the current platform can allow a larger capacity of – up to kWh and larger in battery storage and up to kW in inverter power inside a single enclosure, under Management is currently in the process of applying for UL9540A, with hopes of receiving approval by November, To increase advertisable battery capacities, requires additional fire safety Management believes this might be completed by 2023-Q1. Not all states require the UL9540 or UL9540A However, California does, and other states tend to follow the standards they The Paladin Power ESS also comes factory ready to connect an L1 L2 EV charger, mounted directly to the enclosure as a plug and play add #3) Double The Output: When solar is present, the Paladin Power ESS works like a kW This is what the average air conditioner needs just to start up, and by default power every other load in the home, including electric Here’s how that works : If you have a KW solar array, as long as enough sun is shining on the photovoltaic (PV) cells, it can add an additional KW to the existing inverter This means a kW inverter at % surge = Add an extra KW from the solar, you get to According to management, no other inverter can do this! Only Paladin Power’s inverter technology is capable of “stacking” power throughout the #4) Faster – And Cheaper – To Install: Current energy storage system technology is heavy at lbs just for the inverters, it can require people to install over the course of several The Paladin Power ESS is light enough to be moved and installed by one contractor in minutes . There is no unnecessary conduit, wire, and junction boxes or large wall space required for In the upper right hand corner of the enclosure, all the contractor has to do is make two connections “ ” and “ ” That’s it! #5) Cost – In Year 1 – For Qualified Buyers: According to EnergySage, it takes ~8.7 years to “break even” on the upfront costs of a residential solar system even longer if they add the cost of Depending on certain financial incentive programs, qualified Paladin Power customers can receive $25k-$80k in rebates, additional tax incentives, and immediate savings on electricity Current and calculated incentives are based on real customer installations during a pilot program with Souther California Edision (SCE) called IDER (integrated distributed energy resources). Paladin Power These financial incentives are a critical competitive advantage for Paladin Power Keep in mind that all of these rebates are approved under the current design and UL parameters the current requirements for the SGIP only require UL1741 for the inverter and UL1973 for the Currently, the SGIP program in California is funded through However, management believes it will likely continue beyond as electric vehicle adoption and renewable energy mandates Residential Case Study 3,100 Sqft California Home With 2 Electric Vehicles Case Study A homeowner we will call Chen lives in a 3,100 sq ft home in Murrieta, Even though he owns two Teslas, he owns zero Tesla Powerwalls . Before he purchased the Paladin Power ESS, he had no viable options for charging his vehicles at Instead, he was forced to take each vehicle to a fast charging station, roughly 5 miles from his Assuming Chen could even find an available station, it takes ~1-3 hours to fully charge from % battery That all changed once he installed the Paladin Power Not only can he charge both EVs at once from the comfort of his own home, his entire home is effectively “off ” Chen not only works from home, he home schools his This means having power – at all times in his home – is mission We’re happy to say that Chen has officially achieved Energy Freedom!
