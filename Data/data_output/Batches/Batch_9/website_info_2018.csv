MOFs were pioneered by Professor Omar Yaghi at the University of California, Berkeley, and have been demonstrated to work for atmospheric water harvesting application, even under very arid Water Harvesting Inc has negotiated an exclusive licensing agreement with UC Berkeley to develop and commercialize water harvesting It has also recently filed its own provisional patent application related to details of the system Water Harvesting Inc combines industry leaders, each with decades of experience, MOF experts, and a commitment to addressing the global challenge of water Our Board of Directors Laura Smoliar, PhD Chairwoman Bill Gallo Member Omar Yaghi, PhD Member Michael O Donnell Secretary Our Team Bill Gallo Chief Executive Officer Bruno Marchon, PhD Vice President of Engineering Eugene Kapustin, PhD Development Engineer Julia Jacobson Manager, Administration Taber Smith, PhD Engineering Leader Gener8 Anita Choi IP Counsel Morrison & Foerster Glass CFO EngineRoom Our Advisors Pete Johnson Director, Azimuth Capital Management Fred Kittler Founder and Managing Partner, Firelake Capital Our Technology MOFs, or frameworks, are an innovative class of materials constructed from units, joined by simple organic molecules, that result in an open crystalline MOFs are exceptionally porous: one gram of a typical MOF has a surface area which can cover an entire football Recently, MOFs have shown potential in storing hydrogen and natural gas, capturing carbon dioxide from flue gas, and for heterogeneous catalysis applications [1]. Water Harvesting Inc seeks to use MOFs as a material for water harvesting even in the most arid regions of the In , the first ever Water Harvester was built and tested by UC Berkeley, to capture water from the atmosphere [2]. In , the same team deployed a MOF harvester powered by natural sunlight in Arizona, to produce water of drinking quality [3-4]. Professor Omar Yaghi s new, patented , is based on aluminum cations linked by 3 acid It is synthesized in water, does not require any catalyst, and can be to industrial One unique feature of this MOF is that it works like a sponge to atmospheric It captures water even under extremely low humidity and high temperature conditions, and unlike other porous materials such as zeolites, water does not require much heat to desorb from MOF materials, making them the materials of choice for water harvesting in dry Water Harvesting Inc now owns the exclusive rights to commercialize the use of UC Berkeley s MOF materials for atmospheric water For this purpose, we have developed a technology that exploits the unique ability of MOF materials to adsorb and release water seamlessly, with little energy penalty, unlike conventional, water We have filed a provisional Patent Application (#62 795,332) describing the system design, and plan on offering commercial units for purchase in the near [1] The Chemistry and Applications of Frameworks, Science (2013) [2] Water Harvesting from Air with Frameworks Powered by Natural Sunlight, Science (2017) [3] Atmospheric Water Harvesting Device for Arid Climates, Nature Communications (2018) [4] Practical Water Production from Desert Air, Science Advances (2018) Our Partners Contact Us Send us an email (click below) and we will get back to you as soon as possible!
