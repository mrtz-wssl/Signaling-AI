There has been an explosion of interest in targeted protein degradation in recent years due to the convergence of two advances: heterobifunctional molecules were optimized to be suitable for in vivo use, and clinically approved drugs were found to function via the âmolecular glueâ degradation Together, these scientific advances offer an opportunity to tackle targets and diseases that had been considered intractable to conventional drug Molecular Glue As A Solution to âUndruggableâ Targets Historically, conventional therapeutics fell into the categories of large and small molecule drugs, with large molecules such as antibodies able to target extracellular targets, and small molecules able to target extracellular or intracellular Small molecule campaigns are typically limited to targets shown to be âdruggableâ. Druggable targets have a binding pocket that can support binding to a drug molecule with appropriate properties for clinical Binding alone is often insufficient to achieve a biological effect, so drug binding in the pocket must also perturb cellular biology in a way that is clinically However, many proteins lack druggable binding pockets, or drug binding alone does not cause the desired biological effect, and these targets have been considered âundruggableâ. Targeted protein degradation offers a path to solving this problem by triggering the destruction of the target protein by the proteasome, thereby removing all of the associated biological While heterobifunctional drugs still require a druggable binding pocket on the target protein, molecular glue drugs are able to bypass this requirement, and as such offer a differentiated approach to drug discovery with different rules and the potential to target a broad section of the Molecular glue drugs have been described relatively recently, but the science is now and the therapeutic mechanism has been clinically validated through an understanding of the recruitment of neomorphic substrates to CRL4 CRBN by thalidomide analogs, as well as the recruitment of RBM39 to CRL4 DCAF15 by Further Reading Lenalidomide causes selective degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 in multiple myeloma KrÃ¶nke J, Udeshi ND, Narla A, Grauman P, Hurst SN, McConkey M, Svinkina T, Heckl D, Comer E, Li X, Ciarlo C, Hartman E, Munshi N, Schenone M, Schreiber SL, Carr SA, Ebert Jan 343(6168) doi: science.1244851.
