A: Â Â We use publicly available satellite data and other environmental variables to build statistical models that map soil organic carbon We test our models using soil samples we collect ourselves and from our partner Q:Â Â How does your method lower the number of soil samples required to measure soil carbon? A: Â Â Every model we develop has learned from thousands of soil samples, which means that the model adapts to new locations with a small number of additional This is one of the biggest benefits of a machine learning We also make precise, targeted sample plans to further improve sampling Taken together, this means that we can measure soil carbon with fewer additional And we can do it faster, at lower Q: Â Â What do you mean you donât require farm practice data? How does that work? A: Â Â We developed our technology to lessen the burden of collecting farm practice Since we combine real observations of the land with machine learning, we can quantify soil carbon directly without using biogeochemical In other words, we directly observe carbon rather than making a guess based on what the farmer has Q: Â Â How do you know that your methods are accurate?
