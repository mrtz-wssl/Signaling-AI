The core of all of our products is the Stelo Transaction It does three things: Simulation - simulates the transaction and lets you know what assets are leaving and entering your Enrichment - enriches the transaction with on and data such as human readable names, recognizable NFTs, and Risk analysis - analyzes the transaction and surfaces risk factors to help prevent you from getting phished or Stelo Extension v2 One of the most powerful aspects of web3 is that any developer can build a website that interacts with any Developers don’t have to ask permission to interact with Uniswap pools or utilize OpenSea’s marketplace However, one of the risks of decentralization is that websites can tell you they’re doing one thing and actually construct a transaction that does something The source of truth needs to live outside of the The Stelo extension secures every transaction and acts like a firewall for your It translates complex transactions and signatures into plain English so you can transact with Here’s an example: Safe transaction in Stelo (left) MetaMask (right).
