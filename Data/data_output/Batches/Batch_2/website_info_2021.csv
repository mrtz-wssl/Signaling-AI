$67.5 million Series A financing to accelerate development of its , liquid biopsy platform for early cancer The financing was led by leading life sciences and tech investors Section and Casdin Capital , with participation from Two Sigma Ventures , who have been integral to advancing cancer diagnostics and artificial intelligence machine learning Exai Bioâs platform delivers unprecedented clinical insight into cancer biology from blood samples enabling early and accurate diagnosis of cancer to inform personalized care Unlike first generation liquid biopsy tests which measure circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutations and or epigenetic markers (such as ctDNA methylation or fragmentation patterns), Exai Bioâs proprietary platform measures RNA profiles, analyzing them using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning Specifically, Exai Bio is focused on orphan RNA (oncRNA), small RNA sequences not seen in normal tissue but abundant in In liquid biopsy samples, these oncRNAs translate to higher sensitivity and specificity, ultimately enabling a more accurate diagnosis as compared to liquid biopsy Exai Bioâs approach is applicable across multiple unmet needs in âExai Bio is the first company founded to explore the important role of oncRNA in early and more accurate cancer detection and its important impact on improved patient outcomes and health economics,â said

disease, Exai Bioâs next generation liquid biopsy platform provides actionable information to help inform accurate clinical  Exai Bioâs next generation liquid biopsy platform was developed based on groundbreaking research conducted by Hani Goodarzi, PhD, assistant professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, a member of the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute and the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and and scientific advisor for Exai Goodarziâs research, published in Nature, , was the first to identify breast oncRNA and its role as a robust promoter of breast cancer The paper also identified the opportunity to utilize oncRNA for early cancer detection via liquid Since , Goodarziâs research into oncRNA has continued, and today, Exai Bioâs liquid biopsy platform has been utilized in multiple studies, most notably including the 2 study collaboration with 2 is a neoadjuvant, adaptive clinical trial designed to improve outcomes in individuals with breast Goodarzi will present data from 2 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, The poster, circulating orphan RNAs reflect treatment response and survival in breast cancer, â demonstrates that the changes in oncRNA content of the blood are a significant predictor of clinical The study results show that oncRNA âfingerprintsâ are and enable building predictive models of tumor These data will be presented on Thursday, December , at 7:00 AM Central Goodarzi commented, âItâs incredibly rewarding that our early research and the discovery of tumor can have such a meaningful impact on early cancer detection and therapy selection, and potentially improve health outcomes for so many people diagnosed

Here at Fermyon, we are most excited about the prospect of writing microservices and web applications in We gave a preview of this when we built But with Spin, we’re taking things to a new Most specifically, Spin offers a framework for building What do we mean when we talk about a “framework”? A framework provides a set of features and conventions that assist a developer in reaching their desired goal faster and with less Ruby on Rails and Python Django are two good Spin is a framework for web apps, microservices, and other It provides the interfaces for writing WebAssembly modules that can do things like answer HTTP One unique thing about Spin is that it is a Rust and Go both have robust support in Spin, but you can also write Python, Ruby, AssemblyScript, Grain, C C++, and other We are excited to already be using Spin in The Spin docs are (appropriately enough) running on That website is powered by the Bartholomew CMS system and is running on an HA Nomad cluster .
