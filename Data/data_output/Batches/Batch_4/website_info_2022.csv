As founder of Pivotal Labs, I applied XP principles to the development of applications for a wide variety of clients, and we came to be relied on as one of Silicon Valleyâs premier development We worked with major technology companies and venture backed startups alike in a , We stood up software development centers across the United States, and eventually around the April : Pivotalâs cloud Acquired in by EMC, we were spun out a year later to become Pivotal Software, where we built and deployed Pivotal Cloud Foundry for clients and developed applications to run on this open cloud We helped Global companies and government agencies modernize their software development capabilities and deploy mission critical systems to the We also helped our clients operate this sophisticated platform, adding site reliability engineering to our evolving April : A pandemic was We wanted to At the request of the former director of the CDC, I assembled a team of former Pivots and friends to quickly build software infrastructure and applications for state Contact investigation teams were overwhelmed by the amount of data they now needed to process, and lacked the right digital tools to identify and assist those potentially affected by We stepped in and replaced slow, unreliable applications cobbled together in haste with new systems designed to be scalable, reliable and But that wasnât the end of the State governments donât operate software easily they are typically understaffed in IT and have many competing demands for their time and We had delivered software that functioned well and served a critical need, but we couldnât do what Pivotal had always done and hand it over to our So we ran it Somewhat to our surprise, the model of building and running software turned out to be both efficient and We still collaborated closely with our clients, but the closed loop allowed us to optimize all aspects of the software development lifecycle with improved feedback In fact, it worked so well that we decided to create a company to continue this work, Ratio PBC .
