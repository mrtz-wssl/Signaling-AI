The basics # When you first learned about GraphQL one of the first concepts you had to understand is that GraphQL sends Queries via POST Because of this it s not possible to cache these Caching is only possible on GET The last paragraph is not really To be more precise, it s not possible for Browsers and intermediate caches like CDNs to cache POST Persisted Queries # Some of you might have already heard of persisted To get everyone on the same page: Persisted Queries are a very simple You take a Query, store it on a server and give it a Now you create a GET endpoint that accepts variables as Query The Query is now persisted and can be cached easily by HTTP Here s an example: query AllOpenTasks tasks ( done : false ) id title Copy If you persist this AllOpenTasks Query your endpoint might look like this: http : example . com api AllOpenTasks ? variables = ""done"" : ""false"" Copy Considerations if you want to roll your own # You have to write and maintain the code You need to deploy and operate another service Will you redeploy the service if the persisted Queries change? Keep in mind that you cannot always upgrade all clients at once You need to figure out the exact headers to set Do you want to support caching for private (authenticated) APIs too? In that case you also have to validate the user s identity Do you want the Cache server to also keep responses in a cache? If so, will you deploy the service multiple times for high availability and performance reasons? If so, you also have to find a solution for a shared Let WunderGraph take care of it # Solving all the above problems might not be your core ",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210105094541/https://wundergraph.com/', 'timestamp': '20210105094541'}",20210105094541.0,1.0
