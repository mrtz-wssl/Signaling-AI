It’s a bank with thousands of loan documents, but zero visibility into the terms and conditions that impact the value of those A government agency with hundreds of project agreements that need to be audited and updated due to a regulatory A commercial real estate firm with hundreds of contracts, but no insight into millions of dollars in underlying A health care system with dozens of doctors spending “pajama time” every night recording and writing patient notes in a laborious and disconnected Now multiply those cases by hundreds of thousands of companies and organizations around the That’s document It is not enough to shrug our shoulders and say “hey, we just make the tools… we are not responsible for how people use ” It’s time for the tech industry to step up and help solve these Right now, there are lots of smart people working to use artificial intelligence to tackle problems like asteroid mining or AI enhanced We think that is great, but we are focused on using AI to solve much more mundane We are a document engineering company, and we think AI can solve the information management problems that afflict businesses large and If that sounds boring compared to human settlements on Mars, that is We think “Boring AI” could be a pretty big We envision a world where documents that are written for humans can, quickly and securely thanks to AI, be understood as data by Even better, we envision a world where AI helps people construct documents that are engineered for maximum data reuse from the start, fostering human creativity and unlocking billions of dollars in increased efficiency, improved compliance, and business insights for companies around the We know we are not the only people thinking about these issues – researchers and academics and other luminaries have been raising these issues for But we think science and technology have advanced to the point where we can finally solve these We see five principles that can lead us to more effective solutions: First, we need to bring together multiple scientific domains in innovative and powerful Of course we need to apply artificial intelligence in natural language processing using machine learning methods like neural networks or Bayesian But we also need other disciplines like image processing and recognition, information, declarative markup p , and even approaches inspired from natural sciences like the theories of cognition and Breaking down the walls and combining these disciplines will give us new ways to solve these very hard Second, instead of “Big Data,” we need AI that understands “Small Data”– the unique sets of business documents distinctive to individual There is a lot of this “Small Data,” and each company’s small data is What people call Big Data artificial intelligence these days is usually just highly supervised machine learning on massive The preparation of those datasets is labor intensive and prohibitively expensive for most individual We need algorithms that are smart enough to figure out your specific documents in your company or even your division within your company, in potentially small volume, with only minimal learning and Third, this focus on “Small Data” will enable us to maintain the privacy and security of each individual As an industry, it’s fine to develop and hone algorithms using massive amounts of publicly available documents and data sets, but we should not use learning from one customer to train algorithms for use with other At a time when some are looking to combine data from multiple customers to increase their insights, raising questions about privacy and security, we believe it is better to treat each customer’s data as its own unique Fourth, past attempts to use AI to try to solve business data and document problems have failed because they focused on the wrong altitud",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20200530035800/https://www.docugami.com/', 'timestamp': '20200530035800'}",20200530035800.0,1.0
