This article was originally posted on Forbes . Until now, smart home technology has primarily been enjoyed by early Most mainstream users have not been motivated to add more connectivity to their homes, but I believe thatâs about to Last year, the number of homes with Alexa and Google assistants nearly doubled to % . Europeans have been more suspicious about inviting one of the tech giants into their home, but even Europe has seen significant adoption . The average family is trying to figure out what to do with a smart speaker in their kitchen, so they buy a smart light or switch to try out the Jetsonsâ And so it begins: The race among Amazon, Google and Apple to become the dominant assistant is finally driving mainstream adoption of smart home The smart home industry now includes all the major hardware Every household brand you can think of has been experimenting with a few connected product lines for a few years and now feel ready to take the My company provides smart home experiences optimized for usability based on user research and comparative analysis of existing smart home Through this experience, Iâve seen firsthand that to be suitable for mass adoption, smart home products need to be useful and Thatâs the challenge they will face over the next few Below is my advice for how leaders in the space can start to overcome those two Usefulness A useful product allows the user to accomplish a desired If people canât see the utility of a smart home product, they wonât try For some products, the main utility comes from the underlying devices rather than its connectivity, so users might not want to invest in a smart version of that For example, the main utility of your coffee maker is to brew you a cup of The fact that you could turn on a connected coffee maker remotely adds little utility, so people might naturally be skeptical of giving it a try until there is a killer use If youâre stuck on how to start, try looking to the many useful smart home devices for inspiration, such as the ability to automatically turn off lights, heating and appliances when leaving oneâs home for convenience and to save Other popular use cases come from cameras, motion detectors and security Connecting monitoring devices to other devices in the home can unlock even more security features, like automatically turning on the lights when an outdoor camera spots a potential intruder to create the appearance of someone being at Itâs also easy to see the utility of automating tasks that people donât enjoy, such as vacuuming, mowing and watering The smart home space is already full of use cases that mainstream users find useful, which means there is a lot of insight new entrepreneurs can gain simply by studying what made other brands Usability A productâs utility isnât Users also need to be able to figure out how to use the product to derive the For a smart home product, the usability of the digital interface is Many devices are controlled with mobile apps, many of which are not particularly , and poor usability is frequently reflected in reviews and My company creates apps for smart home devices, so Iâve learned a few ways to ensure your brandâs product is First, a product needs to be for its intended purpose and For example, unlike a social media or gaming app, a smart home app will not be used multiple hours per As a result, users will not have an opportunity to learn any new interactions in the Smart home apps are mostly until you want to quickly change the temperature of your thermostat or check when someone last entered your Busy users need to instantly be able to figure out how to accomplish a task without poking around in the Your app should also leverage usersâ existing knowledge, such as standard iOS and Android features seen in other apps and features that remind users of interactions in the offline world, like simple toggles and Your app should also anticipate what actions users will want to take most frequently and make those features prominent on the home Hide less common features in logical places in the user The best smart home experiences balance usability and usefulness by making the smart home product immediately useful without much This way, users can instantly experience the value of the smart home product before investing much Early Adopters Iâve observed that many smart home products have not struck the right balance between usefulness and usability for mass Thatâs because until now, smart home products have mostly been used by early adopters who have influenced how these products evolved over Unfortunately, Iâve found that early adopters tend to have very different expectations of usability and Early adopters expect products to be useful and will not use them They tend to be more , prefer to have more features that cover all th",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20191211220632/https://www.kraftful.com/', 'timestamp': '20191211220632'}",20191211220632.0,1.0
