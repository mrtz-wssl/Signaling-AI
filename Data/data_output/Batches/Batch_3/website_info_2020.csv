Issue #1: Innovation has characteristics that fall under the mandate of multiple regulatory Each regulatory agency has different reasons on why they want to regulate tech Let’s take the example of crypto: We want to regulate crypto because….. Regulatory Agency Regulatory Jurisdiction CFPB Crypto is issued to consumers and we oversee consumer protection laws SEC Crypto is used as ownership in companies and trade like stocks therefore, they are classified as securities CFTC Crypto is used in derivative products and we regulate futures, swaps and options FinCEN Crypto is used fraudulently and we create rules to combat illicit activity and money laundering OCC Crypto is held at a custodian and we regulate trust and depository institutions FINRA Crypto is traded on exchanges so these exchanges should comply with broker dealer regulations Fed Crypto might impact monetary policy in the future NYDFS + State Regulators Crypto is held by companies and individuals in our We should know the risks of products and services offered in our A s imilar analysis can be applied to marketplace lending companies like Kabbage and While lending is considered traditional banking activity overseen by the Fed, OCC, CFPB and state regulators, most marketplace lenders are packaging loans into securitized products which would require them to comply with securities Get the point? No one wants 8 different regulators to regulate different parts of their Not only would this be an operational nightmare, but it’s expensive for a small or medium sized business to spend a huge chunk of revenue on compliance resources, legal expenses, regulatory assessment fees and fines and Issue #2: Tech companies want to focus on creating new products, as they should, and not get bogged down by No one is purposely trying to break the However, following the rules can be expensive and often times the compliance experience necessary to build sustainable controls just doesn’t exist, or can’t be afforded adequately early on within a Experienced lawyers can make huge dents to your balance And we all know, once you find a good lawyer, it’s hard to live without Issue #3: Regulators and innovators don’t speak the same When you’re a bank regulator, you’re accustomed to seeing certain types of reports and hearing specific It can be a huge when technologists are explaining products and not using proper banking terminology such as securitization, hypothecation and It’s the same feeling a tech enthusiast has when someone tells them that cloud technology has strong privacy and security So what do we do?

Hardware Wallets Why store my Bitcoin on a hardware wallet instead of an exchange? Bitcoin is sovereign money it gives you ownership over your own financial There is a common expression in the Bitcoin world: not your keys, not your coins ! Whether you own Bitcoin as an investment, as a currency, or as a convenient way to transact on the Internet, it is important that you store your own private keys (and we can help with that). Exchange hacks and losses of funds are common occurrences in the Bitcoin world, and no exchange is too big to The more Bitcoin owned by a single exchange, the larger the incentive for attackers to try to steal your coins – whether external hackers or malicious By storing your own private keys, you can have true ownership over your Bitcoin while removing the ability for hackers to steal large quantities of Bitcoin from custodians – this strengthens the Bitcoin network! For most users, the best way to store your keys is on a specially designed device called a hardware How does Passport compare to other hardware wallets? All hardware wallets make tradeoffs between usability, security, and Below is a brief explanation of the tradeoffs from the leading hardware wallet Ledger’s hardware and firmware are closed source, with a closed source operating system running on the This makes it more difficult for security researchers to discover vulnerabilities that may exist on Ledger’s Many find Ledger devices difficult to use, as there are only two buttons to navigate and a small And Ledger devices are not airgapped they use USB and or This has been shown to cause certain vulnerabilities . Trezor’s hardware and firmware are open source, but they do not use a security chip (more specifically a secure element). This means that an attacker can extract the private keys in only minutes with commonly available hardware (this can be mitigated by using a strong passphrase). Trezor’s Model T is easy to use due to the capacitive touch screen, but makes clear security tradeoffs as the screen and touch panel have embedded processors running unknown Trezor devices are also not airgapped as they use Coldcard has, in our opinion, the best security model, with open source hardware and firmware plus a secure element for storage of private Coldcard also has great security features, such as a PIN entry process and security However, Coldcard is designed for the hardcore Bitcoiner and is challenging for normal Passport uses the same security architecture as Coldcard, with open source hardware and firmware plus a secure element, but places a significant emphasis on intuitive design and Passport’s larger display, alphanumeric keypad, and navigation pad create a pleasant user Its camera and microSD slot ensure airgapped And it uses more trustable components, like a screen without an embedded processor and AAA batteries for I’ve tried other hardware wallets Why should I try Passport? For new users, Passport is designed to be intuitive and The navigation pad and familiar interface make it easy to set up and use If you’ve previously found hardware wallets to be intimidating or difficult, we think you’ll have a better experience with For expert users, Passport uses the same general security architecture as Coldcard but introduces (1) integrated AAA batteries and (2) a camera for more convenient airgapped Passphrase entry is also a breez",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20201230122351/https://foundationdevices.com/', 'timestamp': '20201230122351'}",20201230122351.0,1.0

IL‑2 in the Thatâs why the first challenge in deploying IL‑2 in therapy has been finding ways to steer it away from CD25, which suppresses the immune system, so that IL‑2 can activate the low affinity receptors without first triggering the high affinity receptors containing Another challenge is that IL‑2 is made by the body, so introducing exogenous IL‑2 for therapeutic purposes may lead to excess IL‑2 release, which can then stimulate regulatory Aulos solves both problems with computationally designed antibody therapeutics that bind IL‑2, selectively preventing it from interacting
