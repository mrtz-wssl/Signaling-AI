I welcome our lead investor - Accel Partners,√Ç our angel investors - Akshay Kothari (co-founder and COO of Notion), Renaud Deraison ( Tenable) and Milin Desai (CEO of Sentry) among others for their partnership and trust in You can read more about the announcement here . In the last months of existence, Akto has raised a capital of $4.5M, became a team of members, served few of the largest alpha customers, and processed billion+ API We wrote our first line of code in November last year, and now have SaaS and versions running in production environments of customers across the Super looking forward to the exciting future What problem is Akto solving?√Ç Over million developers around the world use thousands of APIs These APIs carry sensitive data of users which if leaked can cause irreparable damage to Security teams struggle to secure these APIs because of: √¢¬Ä¬ç Lack of API inventory - If you are a developer or security engineer reading this, you can relate to this problem and probably have faced it in your own Agile and continuous release cycle movement has led to developers adding new APIs and updating existing ones very There is constant back and forth between developers and security engineers to get an updated API Over % of the companies we talked to face this Some of them have tried to solve this by creating a process around it - every time a developer creates an API or updates an API,√Ç he she will create an updated API documentation for Although this solves the problem but√Ç really slows down the development √¢¬Ä¬ç Hard to do business logic API security testing - Developers and security engineers don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have a way to test their APIs for vulnerabilities before new ones are deployed in production or when existing ones are updated with new Most security engineers manually test a few important APIs before a release by writing their custom Some use tools such as Burp which require a lot of manual configuration to Now imagine doing this manually for a large number of APIs (1000s) and a large number of tests (50+) manually checking the results for false positives and following up with developers to remove the vulnerabilities Now imagine this is done before every release ( almost every week for most companies). Yes, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs very very hard to do at scale for most To add to the problem, most of the difficult to detect vulnerabilities are business logic ones which are very hard to test for without Every company we talked to is struggling to solve these Moreover, most teams have to spend months and devops team bandwidth to integrate a tool of their choice as current tools are very hard to install and work "" √¢¬Ä¬î How Akto solves this? Akto is the world√¢¬Ä¬ôs first plug and play API security Akto deploys in less than a minute to create an inventory of APIs, detects PII data leaks, misconfigurations and continuously tests these APIs for business logic flaws like broken authentication and authorization in CI CD We strongly believe in creating a continuous API inventory through API traffic with ZERO performance To do so, you can deploy Akto in your cloud ( AWS or GCP ), select load balancers to mirror your API traffic ( staging or production ) and that√¢¬Ä¬ôs Akto will now be able to generate a continuously updated API inventory for We are launching a very cool BURP extension this week using which you will be able to also mirror traffic through burp and load in Akto solves the testing problem through its robust API security testing module (in beta). Akto continuously learns API context through rich traffic data and uses that to reduce false positives in Once your API inventory is populated, you will be able to run automated business logic tests on all the APIs detected by Our customers Well, I cannot be more thankful to our early customers who have supported us in every way possible to make a great Thanks for believing in us, being patient with the building and solving for We promise to keep you happy with our Some of the largest companies around the world are using Akto to discover and test their Akto has discovered more than ,000 APIs and detected + auth vulnerabilities for its What we did in last months? √¢¬Ä¬ç Our first 5 months: were about building our product for scale which required real production We thank each of our first five customers, who believed in two people without any company existence, used our product and gave continuous Within six months, Akto was able to handle requests a day (Google-scale traffic). √¢¬Ä¬ç First 5 team members: After multiple rejections, no shows, I am so thankful to each of ou",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20230106142335/https://www.akto.io/', 'timestamp': '20230106142335'}",20230106142335.0,1.0
