https://www.atomicjar.com,11885,crunchbase,"Announcing Testcontainers Cloud: Integration Testing has never been easier - AtomicJar, Skip to content AtomicJar, Blog Sign up for early access Menu Technology , Testcontainers Announcing Testcontainers Cloud: Integration Testing has never been easier Let me tell you a When AtomicJar started, our CEO Sergei got himself a shiny new Apple He was eager to start developing the prototype, and of course, as a conscious developer, his first lines of code were followed by an even bigger amount of tests… but that didn’t work! Apparently, the world, or at least one of its subsets in the form of the Docker ecosystem, wasn’t ready for And there are many stories of developers using their own products, but nothing can beat a developer who cannot run their tests! Therefore, ever since then, our focus at AtomicJar has been to make it easy to run tests For ourselves, and, well, a few hundred thousand other developers out This is why we’re excited to announce Testcontainers Cloud! Testcontainers Cloud is the SaaS platform for modern integration testing with real databases, message brokers, cloud services, or any other component of application Built for the existing Testcontainers family of libraries, Testcontainers Cloud brings the same unit experience even to the most constrained development and CI We’re expanding on what development environments are able to use Testcontainers and how teams can use integration tests with the real technologies their applications will use in Let us share more details about Testcontainers Cloud and some feedback we got from the early Welcome Testcontainers Cloud One of the more common approaches to integration testing is running your applications against real instances of databases and other service dependencies locally on developer machines or CI Testcontainers libraries are a popular choice to manage Docker containers with those dependencies and seamlessly integrate them into the tests’ Testcontainers Cloud runs everything that is supported by the Testcontainers library: Cassandra, Cockroach, Couchbase, DB2, MariaDB, MongoDB, MySQL, Neo4j, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL and many other databases using JDBC and R2DBC, as well as modules for popular technologies like Elasticsearch, Kafka, Nginx, RabbitMQ, Solr, Toxiproxy, and Hashicorp While the experience of using integration tests with Testcontainers became almost indistinguishable from unit tests, it imposes various environment restrictions and heavily taxes developer Testcontainer Cloud eliminates all those It runs containers remotely and doesn’t burden the local machine with heavy memory and CPU Instead, Testcontainers Cloud provides plenty of compute power for every container it runs which makes tests snappier to start, faster to execute, and developer workstations more Testcontainers Cloud is fast A typical microservice depends on a few external services, and spinning them up on a single developer workstation or a CI worker machine requires a lot of CPU and On an average developer machine, your Docker installation has access to 2 cores and of memory, which you have to split between all Similarly if you want your laptop not to stall while running a test, you need to severely limit the resources you allocate to the It makes tests slow and the whole experience Testcontainers Cloud uses powerful machines with plenty of resources so your containers start fast and run fast, all while your machine has free resources to run the apps you actually Here’s what developers are saying about their Testcontainers Cloud experience: Testcontainers Cloud shields you from not having a powerful machine, poor internet connection, or not enough space for Docker images and allows you to run fast and repeatable integration tests as a continuous part of your And if you are wondering about the latency – don’t worry, Testcontainers Cloud is closer to you than you think 😉 Testcontainers Cloud is accessible everywhere Testcontainers Cloud is designed to support your existing test suites no matter where you run your Even more – there are various environments where it’s awkward to run Docker workloads! There are continuous integration platforms and solutions that restrict the types of containers that they can run, or require hacky workarounds to allow containers to be run at Or you may not want to your Cloud IDE if you just need to change a couple of lines of ARM based processors are more popular than ever, starting from M1 Macs, to most major cloud providers shifting more and more workloads to these cheaper and more energy efficient compute While it’s possible to run Docker on ARM you are often limited to what images are stable or even available for the ARM Testcontainers Cloud decouples your execution environment from the Docker engine allowing you to effortlessly run your CI jobs no matter what is used to execute them: an ultrabook, Cloud IDEs, Jenkins nodes, Tekton Kubernetes pods, cost efficient ARM build nodes, CI providers that are lacking Docker support and much",startup,None,nan,0.0
