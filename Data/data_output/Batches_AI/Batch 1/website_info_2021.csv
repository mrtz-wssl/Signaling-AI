Your sales conversion model might break because a new marketing campaign Your autonomous vehicle might even break because you donât have enough kangaroos in the training set . Static models degrade because real world data is almost never static â your training set isnât representative of the real world for So, as hard as it is for us ML PhDs to admit, most of the work happens after you train the After grad school, as I spent more time with teams building products, I realized that the best ones don t see their job as training static Instead, they aim to build a continual learning system , a piece of infrastructure that can adapt the model to a continuously evolving stream of At Gantry, we want to help teams build products that improve as they interact with the world, much like laypeople believe they do We think the key to doing so is to transition from training static models to building continual learning From static models to continual learning systems In static ML, you are given a dataset and your job is to iterate on the learning algorithm until the model performs Continual ML adds dataset curation as an outer loop to the iteration Continual learning systems adapt models to the evolving world by repeatedly retraining them on newly curated production For example, if you retrain your model every month on a sliding window of data, then you have built a simple continual learning Your continual learning system only succeeds if the performance benefit from retraining outweighs the So the more valuable your model, the more quickly your system needs to react to degradations in performance and the more carefully it needs to test the new model to make sure it truly performs The more expensive it is to retrain, the more intelligently your system should curate the next dataset using techniques like active learning . When it does succeed, a continual learning system can cause your product to improve as it interacts with the As you collect new data, you can trigger a data flywheel effect , where more data leads to a better model, which improves your product, allowing you to acqu",startup,None,nan,0.0
