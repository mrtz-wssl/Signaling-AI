Classical forecasting methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or exponential smoothing (ETS), fit a single model to each individual time series, and then use that model to extrapolate the time series into the In many applications, however, you have many similar time series across a set of These groupings demand different products, server loads, and requests for web In this case, it can be beneficial to train a single model jointly over all of the time DeepAR+ takes this When your dataset contains hundreds of feature time series, the DeepAR+ algorithm outperforms the standard ARIMA and ETS You can also use the trained model for generating forecasts for new time series that are similar to the ones it has been trained Exponential Smoothing (ETS) is a local statistical algorithm for The Amazon Forecast ETS algorithm calls the ets function in the Package forecast of the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

A SKAG is a method Google Ad gurus use to optimize Google The idea is that it saves you money and gets you more relevant targets for the ads you are serving There are some great writeups on the KlientBoost has written the best one that I’ve But there are also those that think SKAGs are One of the core features of the Aderator is the ability to automatically generate There is some forms to fill out, but its less work than any other method to create Plus, we add the benefit of suggesting a bid Our strategy is simple: You pay less to Google to get more The Strategy The Aderator SKAG strategy works as follows: Select a Campaign Select the Keywords you think relevant Create a template for the ad shown Generate the SKAGs Monitor Performance Let’s explain each of these steps to make it more clear: Step 1: Select a Campaign Let’s assume you have a campaign That campaign will already have phrase match, exact match, and broad matches within Broad Match - When some subset of our keywords are in the users search, our ad will show Phrase Match - The keywords should be in the same order how the user typed them, plus some more So if we want to serve ads when the user types in “Big Blue Bus” then if they type “Big Honkin’ Fat Blue suede shoes Bus” then our ad will also Exact Match - Only if the user types in exactly what we Nothing more, nothing Obviously Broad matches will get your ad shown Then Phrase match, and Exact Match will be shown the When we query all the search terms that set off our ads, then we can see which ones got clicks, which ones got conversions, and how many impressions each ad Our SKAGS will now be built from this list of keywords! Step 2: Select the keywords that are relevant From this list you will see all the strange things people type, including misspellings, exotic searches and other It can be somewhat entertaining to go through this You can select two things here: Terms you want to make SKAGs from Terms you want to negate You may find there are keywords that keep showing up that have nothing to do with your Shut those off so you don’t spend money on this junk! But the other words can be gold! Suppose you are selling disco If your ads keep showing up for the game “Disco Elysium” you probably want to negate that keyword on a broad However, if you find someone was searching: “where can I spend a lot of money on a disco ball” and you got 4 conversions out of it, then for goodness sakes, let’s SKAG that keyword! Step 3: Create a Template for the Ads The most effective SKAGs have the keyword in the Ad We can make most of our ads the same, but have one part of the headline change to For example, suppose I’m running an ad for high end My company is called I can make an Ad template that looks as follows: SuperDuperAdventures | < keyword | Luxury High Adventure Then I can fill in that <keyword with each Ad I This gives me a bulk way of loading Obviously, we may need to refine a bit on some of For the “where can I spend a lot of money on disco balls” we might instead change that to be “Luxury Disco Balls”. Step 4: Generate the SKAGs At this point you’ll have to select which Campaign you want to put all of these SKAGs In the past, we normally select the initial farming campaign and append it with SKAG, or some other This part is all very time consuming if you do it The point is, this is a simple exercise you can go through once a week looking at previous words that were generated from search Each week your campaign becomes more With our SKAGs, we only put exact matches in, give the campaign a reasonable budget and over time take budget from the original farming campaign and move into the SKAG This is impossible to do However, using the Aderator can do this for you and allows you to spend 5 minutes a week Step 5: Monitor performance There are two points to evaluate performance: ROAS How much revenue did you get for every dollar spent on advertizing? The goal is to have a big SKAGs can tell you You may find that some SKAGs don’t pay For example",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210310221700/https://castlerock.ai/', 'timestamp': '20210310221700'}",20210310221700.0,1.0

Does it ever make dumb mistakes? Would you trust it to do anything really important Technology Humans have been outsourcing tasks to computers ever since computers were At first, the tasks were purely Over the years as AI has gotten smarter the range of tasks for which AI is competent has grown Though there is considerable clash nowadays around the limits of AI, so long as it is based on Gen2 principles it cannot replace the human in tasks that require We believe the future of AI lies in extending human capabilities into areas where humans cannot act alone simply because the scale of decision making is beyond Sensepoint has Developed An ontology fabric that can wrap around any Gen2 AI ML application in any domain: whether embedded in the real world (e.g., running on unmanned vessels) or embedded in the information world (e.g., running on a server).
