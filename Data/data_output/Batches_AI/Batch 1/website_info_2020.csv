How do you decide which AI vendor is trustworthy, suggesting that you should place your trust in them? Once you have decided to trust an AI system, how do you know if your trust was misplaced or betrayed? How do you know if your trust was even mutual or warranted in the first place? The absence of an immediate and obvious answer to these questions should be We are headed toward a future in which AI systems play a significant role in informing and enabling This is happening whether such AI systems are trustworthy or There is thus a clear danger to our future flourishing that is posed by widespread misplaced or unwarranted trust placed in untrustworthy AI Healthcare is the industry with the most significant amount of AI Unfortunately, current FDA standards for regulatory clearance of such AI systems in healthcare - which are often regarded and treated as a statement of assurance - surprisingly only require information about technical ability, validity, and accuracy compared to a previously cleared device, also known as a prior Once the FDA clears a device, vendors can make unsubstantiated Further, there are no economic or professional incentives to track whether or not their AI proves beneficial for patient care and reliably improves patient outcomes when deployed in the real Nor is there any substantive requirement or incentive for vendors to collect and publicly disclose even the most basic information about their AI systems, let alone address known safety risks associated with using their systems in different contexts and among diverse patient We should not be surprised that vendors typically choose to disclose little or nothing that can be used to validate and verify the trustworthiness of their devices Nonetheless, it is widely accepted that the companies that develop these algorithmic tools are responsible for providing of their devices’ safety and (ii) Can of safety and reliability be considered trustworthy? Policymakers in the UK and EU have been far more proactive in cultivating an independent assurance ecosystem for trustworthy Much less attention has been paid to AI assurance in the This seems to be largely because the developer community can control the conversation about the AI system in They are most interested in talking about technical solutions like ‘explainable AI’ (XAI) as an adequate and reasonable basis for trusting their All stakeholders have been too easily persuaded that XAI will be the panacea that cracks the ‘trust ’ Trustworthiness is implicit in the vendor marketing Still, the XAI information they present at best results in misplaced trust and, at worst, creates false confidence in untrustworthy Vendors using terms like explainable, interpretable, and observable interchangeably have created widespread misconceptions and They have manipulated expectations among stakeholders who do not fully understand the epistemic institutions that are necessarily involved in developing AI Trustworthiness cannot be commodified or secured transactionally, and it especially cannot be technologically This is because decisions about trustworthiness necessarily involve value decisions and not mere technical performance Independent data on system design and performance is typically only available via journals and is rarely collected during prospective clinical The findings are likely to be misleading at Even developers who disclose information about their system design and performance in journals do not provide much of the critical information needed to evaluate their value decisions or their device’s A recent review of compliance with recommendations from different model reporting guidelines comprising unique items by developers of commonly used AI models embedded in the Epic electronic health record (EHR) system found a median completion rate of percent with the lowest rates of completion for information on model usefulness, reliability, transparency, and Another review published in early of published models developed between using evidence from EHRs found only limited evidence of improvement in the quality of model validation reporting over that A review of AI imaging validation studies in the literature found only of eligible studies followed bare minimum best practices for model validation and (iii) Existential Risks of untrustworthy systems are already embedded in our It is often the case that we must trust or rely upon experts and their These experts tend to be human But, increasingly often, they are ‘artificial intelligence’ experts, such as conversational diagnostic expert algorithm systems (i.e., the Babylon chatbot).
