Беспилотный комплекс предназначен для работы на складах с многоярусными фронтальными Ширина проходов (узкопроходные либо широкопроходные) не имеет Также можем рассмотреть возможность эксплуатации БПЛА на складах с набивными или гравитационными ​ Обязательно ли наличие адресной системы хранения на складе? Но при отсутствии адресной системы хранения невозможно обеспечить точность пересчёта, а также эффективно проводить выборочную ​ Какие требования к маркировке мест хранения? Необходимо присутствие или на фронтальной стороне Формат (1D, ) и ориентация по вертикали не имеют не должны быть замяты, нанесены с перехлёстом на край паллеты, а также подвержены иным воздействиям, препятствующим их считывание без механического к ним ​ Какая стоимость беспилотного комплекса и что она включает? Мы не осуществляем продажу беспилотных комплексов, а оказываем услуги по проведению ​ В чём преимущества сервиса перед приобретением? • При сервисной модели у заказчика нет необходимости обучать и держать специалистов по работе с беспилотными комплексами, нет необходимости в организации соответствующей инфраструктуры хранения и • Мы постоянно совершенствуем наш продукт, с учётом тиражирования новых технологий и поступления обратной связи от заказчиков, а, следовательно, мы гарантируем нашим клиентам, что каждый новый цикл инвентаризации осуществляется с самыми современными техническими решениями и программными ​ Как происходит верификация данных инвентаризации, полученных с помощью беспилотного комплекса? Есть два принципиальных варианта: При предоставлении клиентом доступа происходит непосредственная интеграция с системой управления складом (WMS) При невозможности интегрироваться с WMS происходит выгрузка данных сканирования в согласованный формат (например, ). ​ Насколько значительные изменения в инфраструктуре складского комплекса требуются для перехода на инвентаризацию с помощью беспилотных комплексов? Наша технология не требует от заказчика вносить изменения в инфраструктуру Начиная сотрудничество и анализируя объект заказчика, мы лишь даём рекомендации, какие коррективы могут повысить эффективность и привлекательность нашего сервиса для Фактически ключевые рекомендации сводятся к формату и месту расположения наносимой ​ Как начать с вами работу?
