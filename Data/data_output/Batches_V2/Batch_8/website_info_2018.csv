Heading i psykologi, Anna Stelvig A nna Stelvig er mag i Psykologi og var den fÃ¸rste i Danmark til at skrive speciale om prÃ¦stationsangst. Hun har rÃ¥dgivet og undervist i emnet i mere end Ã¥r. Om Ã¥rsagen til at hun i stiftede StudyMind (i dag Minday) siger hun: Det kalder jeg min nervÃ¸sitet, som har det med at vise sig i situationer, hvor jeg skal prÃ¦stere foran andre En lille trold, som rumsterer inde i kroppen og forsÃ¸ger at fuppe mig til at tro, at jeg ikke kan klare Jeg har lÃ¦rt at acceptere ham, men jeg giver ham ingen opmÃ¦rksomhed PÃ¥ den mÃ¥de forstyrrer han ikke mit fokus og jeg kan fÃ¥ sagt alt det, jeg har forberedt mig pÃ¥.

Og samtidig redskaber som kunne forbedre formidling og forankre viden, sÃ¥ bedre trivsel og stÃ¦rkere resultater kunne opnÃ¥s af Derfor stiftede jeg StudyMind (i dag Minday). Jeg er utrolig glad og stolt over, at vores lÃ¸sning konstant bliver videreudviklet til at revolutionere lÃ¦ring, og i dag bruges den af bÃ¥de uddannelsesinstitutioner og virksomheder til at forbedre prÃ¦stationer.

Another scenario we see all the time in our physical therapy clinic is when people go to the Doctors, and the Doctor tells them to rest and “try these painkillers” to “see how it goes”.
