We've turned the map into a video-based social calendar with group chat that captures future plans with a collaborative ""group event story""™ consisting of a Video Invite® + Video RSVPs. Imagine a fun video walkie talkie-like experience. There are plenty of invite services that ‘list’ who’s coming to your party or event but none of them ‘show you’ who’s coming and how excited they are to join in. Have a good time between the good times with Slap. Watch the hype and momentum build for what you and your friends are looking forward to doing. ****************** How to use Slap? ****************** Slap: Bored? Record a Slap (Video Invite®) to start a ""group event story""™ telling your friends or the world what you want to do. Personalize them with Lenses powered by Snap AR. Then pin the location of where you’ll be and when on your map. Explore: Looking for something to do? Surf the Slap Map to see what your friends have posted they’ll be doing. Don't miss out, event stories disappear 24 hours after the fun starts in real life. Slap back: Find something interesting to do? Slap back by recording a Video RSVP to tell your friends you’re in. Start enjoying the anticipation as the Slaps start coming in and you see how psyched everyone is. Messaging: Once you Slap back that you'll be joining in, you'll unlock the group event chat with everyone else who will be going to what's being planned before, during and after the event. **************** When all of your favorite people are sharing and discovering things for you to join in on, life will get a lot more interesting and memorable. That’s our vision and we appreciate you helping to spread the word with your closest friends. We’ve worked hard to bring you Slap and we're having a lot of fun doing it. We would love to hear what you like, don’t like or want to see in the future. Thanks in advance for letting us know at: helpme@slap.events. Follow us on TikTok and Instagram @Slap.Sounds.Like.A.Plan and don’t forget to #SlapSoundsLikeAPlan so we can see all the fun you’re having.",1-10,,,,,,,2.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,2020,42334,False,False

Once the brand started to gain momentum, Kemper moved its board production to a snowboard factory in Montreal, Canada for the 1988/89 snowboarding season. In 1989/90 the snowboard production moved to Austria.  Kemper Snowboards quickly became one of the biggest snowboarding brands in snowboard history and competed directly against Burton Snowboards, Sims Snowboards, and Barfoot Snowboards. The Kemper snowboarding brand was best remembered for fully embracing snowboarding’s neon period in both their snowboard graphics and their incredible range of funky outerwear. In 1989 business was booming and Kemper had one of the best professional snowboard teams of the era. David Kemper eventually partnered with a windsurfing distribution company in Glendale, California called the Romney Group who added Kemper Snowboards to their portfolio of snowboarding brands. During that time, David relocated to California to help oversee the business, team management, and the growing product line. In 1992, David sold his remaining shares of the company to focus on his college education.  By 1994 the company was sold to an in-line skate company on the east coast. A couple of years shortly after, Kemper Snowboards officially went out of business. In the winter of 2018, Jib Hunt, a former professional snowboarder, relaunched the Kemper Snowboards brand. In the summer of 2019, Hunt moved Kemper’s headquarters from the east coast to Park City, Utah to better position the snowboarding brand for growth and exposure within the Utah snowboarding scene. Kemper Snowboards produces freestyle snowboards, park snowboards, powder snowboards, splitboards, and snowboards packages. The original Kemper professional snowboard team consisted of Mike Basich, Tina Basich, Dave Dowd, Martin Gallant, Kurt Heine, Andy Hetzel, Brett Johnson, Adam Merriman, George Pappas, Nick Perata, J.D.

Instead, it should be able to blend in seamlessly with the accessories, furniture, and decor that you have around your house and compliment your home's design.
