Because of high levels of fraud associated with these credits in particular, the IRS is required to withhold associated refunds Furthermore, this restriction applies to your entire refund, even the portion of it having nothing to do with these But if you’re not planning to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax, and you file your return electronically without errors, you can typically expect to get your money back within three weeks’ More: Here’s the first day you can file your taxes this year More: What do I need to know if I sold stocks in ? You’ll give yourself more time to address an underpayment Though most tax filers wind up with a refund each year, you may land in that rare but notable category of workers who end up owing money on their And if that’s the case, you may be in trouble, especially if your underpayment is sizable and your savings are On the other hand, if you give yourself two and a half months to come up with a plan for paying your tax debt, as opposed to waiting until the last minute, you stand a better chance of avoiding the penalties that come with paying the IRS Consider this: An estimated % of Americans have absolutely no money in the bank .

One final benefit of getting your return in early is having one less thing to worry about between now and Once that return is out of your hands, you’ll be able to move forward and focus your efforts and mental energy Though there are plenty of good reasons to file your taxes early this year, here’s one good reason not to: You’re missing key information that could compromise the accuracy of your While it’s helpful to get your taxes in ahead of schedule, if you don’t have the data needed to be precise, you’re better off Otherwise, you’ll increase your chances of getting audited, and that’s a whole other potential nightmare to contend The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .
