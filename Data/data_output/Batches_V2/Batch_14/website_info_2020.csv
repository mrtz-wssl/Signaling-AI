Technology We developed a novel approach to training speech recognition models on unlabeled It is an iterative process with each iteration yielding higher accuracy We built a Soniox speech model with no human labeled Our goal was to build a highly accurate speech recognition system with no or very little human If that were possible, then the cost of building a fairly accurate speech recognition system is zero or extremely Furthemore, one can apply the same approach to other languages and accurately recognize speech in languages where no system exists or does not work Problem To provide more context, let us take a quick look at the typically process of building a state of the art speech recognition system: The first stage consists of collecting a large amount of labeled To build a reasonablly good system, about ,000 hours or more of labeled data is Labeled data consists of an audio and its The transcript is typically obtained by asking humans to manually transcribe the audio, listen to the audio and write down or verify every single spoken word in the Once a sufficient amount of labeled data has been collected, we train a speech recognition model on the collected labeled The major drawbacks of this approach are: Time Consuming and Expensive It takes a significant amount of time (one or more years) to collect a large amount of labeled Humans have to listen, write down or verify every word that is being said in the This labeling process is very expensive and not many organizations can afford to pay for the labeled Limited Vocabulary Human knowledge is vast and consists of a large number of different Limited labeled data covers only a small subset of the Thus many topics and domains of human knowledge are not well represented many words do not occur in the labeled data or occur only a small number of Small Amount of Data Even with an extremely large budget for labeling data (millions of dollars), one can collect a relatively small amount of labeled data compared to an “infinite” amount of unlabeled audio and text data that is available on the Limited Languages The same process has to be repeated for every single The cost of collecting labeled data scales linearly with the number of This may be feasible for top languages, but makes it prohibitively expensive for many other Limited Acoustics Due to the relatively small amount of labeled data, the diversity of audio is Typically, a small number of noises, speakers, and accents are included in the labeled data compared to the real world acoustic These were the key factors that motivated our research Our goal was to explore if it is possible to build a speech recognition system with no or very little human labeling and still obtain a fairly accurate speech recognition Soniox Solution We invented a novel approach to building speech recognition systems on unlabeled No Human Labeled Data We built a Soniox speech model with no human labeled data, we did not pay a single dollar to label the data to train the speech Acoustics The model has been exposed to acoustic conditions, which include tens of thousands of speakers with accents from most countries in the world and a huge amount of background Iterative Process It is an iterative learning process with each iteration yielding higher accuracy The model keeps with more training Language Agnostic The approach is language agnostic and can be applied to Vast Amount of Data The model is trained on a vast amount of human knowledge including people, places, geography, education, technology, engineering, medicine, health, law, science, art, history, food and Recognition It achieves recognition on many domains when compared to human Soniox Benchmark We thoroughly benchmarked our system on many different domains and audio conditions
