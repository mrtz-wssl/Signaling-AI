For the most vexing problem in the history of the world, it really is as simple as This whole thing is as much decision theory as It‚Äôs tempting to want to think about climate change the way we think about anything else‚Äîto try and figure it But the work has already been This type of epistemology is a consensus, we must believe Imagine for a moment that instead of climate change, we‚Äôre talking about an pandemic or an alien invasion, or something on that If we wanted to form a judgment for such a complex problem, how would we go about it? We‚Äôd want the best experts in the world to study the problem exhaustively, and we‚Äôd want their ideas filtered through the most advanced supercomputing to form empirical It‚Äôs a global issue, so we‚Äôd want global participation, collaborating, competing, offering nuanced judgments and checking each other‚Äôs We‚Äôd want to see whether past predictions had panned out and how accurately, all to narrow the cone of That‚Äôs exactly what has The world formed the IPCC to convene the best thinking from countries for the past thirty Their conclusions have been consistent and spot A good example is NASA‚Äôs predictions‚Äîthey have the best data set of any country, covering % of the globe and going back to the ‚Äîand their warnings have been astonishingly accurate to within degrees The IPCC‚Äôs consensus statements use words like unequivocal, unprecedented, % probability, severe and irreversible The conclusion is that the world must cut carbon emissions in half by , reaching net zero by , and that it‚Äôs If there is a better approach to believability, let‚Äôs hear Another framing is that this is the problem from hell because it features so many qualities that human psychology isn‚Äôt The list is long and We don‚Äôt do well with: , ambiguity, probability, selfishness, counterfactuals, uncertainty, invisibility, tribalism, and on and Well and true, but You could argue the very basis of central features in society like religion is to act in a way so as to be moral, altruistic and achieve distant future Same goes for Insurance is another cornerstone idea we readily accept to mitigate The odds of terrorists exploding a nuclear bomb that kills hundreds of thousands is roughly on the same order of magnitude as climate change, and we move heaven and earth to prevent A big part of civilization has always been to manage risk and complexity through investment and innovation, this is not an exotic Most people sense this is the When Pew asks citizens around the world whether climate change is a major, minor or not a threat, clear majorities across all advanced democracies say major, including In fact, all the opinion trendlines here at home are moving in the right direction, up big over the past five years, and up huge over the past Per Yale, majorities believe global warming is happening, believe it‚Äôs caused by humans, believe most experts are in agreement, believe it is personally important, believe they will be harmed, and are We also support a carbon tax if the proceeds go to environmental restoration or renewable energy R&D.
