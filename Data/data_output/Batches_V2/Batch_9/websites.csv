We uniquely address the largest unmet need in CSF Management; the high rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt occlusion. VP shunts fail at a rate of 50% within 2 years and 80% within 5 years, contributing to repeat revision brain surgeries (each costing upwards of $40,000).  Conceptualized in 2014 in collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and spun out of Alcyone Therapeutics in 2018, Anuncia’s patented portfolio of technologies provide peace-of-mind through innovation to improve daily quality of life for the millions of underserved patients with hydrocephalus and other CSF disorders and their families, who suffer from the clinical, economic, and emotional burden of repeat revision brain surgery due to VP shunt occlusions. Anuncia’s core platform has an elegant mechanism of action using a simple finger depression of a soft silicone dome located under the patient’s scalp to produce a noninvasive, retrograde flush of the patient’s own CSF to restore flow through an occluded catheter and prevent emergency surgery. ReFlow’s initial clinical evidence of flow restoration and reduction of symptoms via acute intervention flushing with follow-up up to 3 years, led neurosurgeons to evaluate ReFlow for prophylactic occlusion prevention in their high-risk patients. Ground-breaking clinical data, now out up to 2 years with 100% success, suggest ReFlow is safe for at-home, prophylactic flushing by patients or caregivers to extend shunt life and eliminate revision brain surgery. Supported by these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ReFlow Breakthrough Device status in 2021, making it eligible for regulatory and reimbursement advantages. With existing profitable reimbursement, Anuncia plans to launch its next-generation ReFlow Mini product line in Q2 2022 and continue clinical studies to support market adoption and premium reimbursement.  With Breakthrough status and strong health economic advantages to improve hospital quality metrics and support New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for rapid market adoption and premium pricing; Anuncia is positioned to be the leader in CSF management and help patients live fuller lives.  ReFlow’s unique ability to improve patient access to noninvasive lifesaving therapy at home or in the clinic and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs, earned it an Honorable Mention in the Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards and landed it on MDDI’s The Ultimate List of Private Companies to Watch.",11-50,2.0,Seed,2023-10-20,1000.0,Seed,1000.0,2.0,11-50,Private,,,6.0,0.0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,0,2018,18173,False,False

By developing solid-state production methods to improve electrodes, the company produces batteries using less energy, materials, and equipment. Intecells is breaking manufacturing out of its decades-long stasis toward a future full of new products and capabilities. Founded in 2018, Intecells invented solid-state printing techniques leveraging cold plasma to fundamentally change the way electrodes are shaped and built into flexible cell formats. The company is revolutionizing what is possible not only for manufacturing and environmental impact but also for consumer product creation for years to come. Partnering with leading battery makers, OEMs, and academic institutions, Intecells plans to bring its innovations from lab to production in 2022. The startup is the brainchild of Dr. Shawn Gayden, a Chinese American inventor, and business executive, who led battery manufacturing research for more than a decade, and Christian Buske, a German entrepreneur whose company first commercialized cold plasma technology decades ago. Intecells’ technologies eliminate binders and solvents for a cleaner electrode-making process, thereby opening new paths for a wide range of cell chemistries and applications across sectors at low production costs.     This game-changing endeavor is a rising tide that lifts everyone in the value chain. For materials and equipment suppliers, collaborating with Intecells adds value to products; for cell manufacturers, applying Intecells’ technology means they can write the rules for future battery production; and for OEMs, Intecells innovations eliminate many traditional and costly design constraints.  By adapting proven cold plasma technology to solve new problems, Intecells’ technology allows the battery to follow product form, not the other way around. The company’s new technology shrinks battery size, with limitless possibilities for shape, while retaining the same power output for less money. In the short term, Intecells is working to demonstrate its flexible batteries that offer personalization for a new wave of consumer products.  The company’s long-term goal is to revolutionize the electric vehicle battery industry and accelerate renewable energy storage. Today, the company creates bespoke technology for customers seeking to improve manufacturing processes and economic outcomes.",1-10,1.0,Seed,2019-07-16,1999999.0,Seed,1999999.0,2.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,0,2018,9120,False,False

Currently, the best place data is very restrictive, expensive, and controlled by a small handful of companies.
