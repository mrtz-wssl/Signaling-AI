Benefits of Oil and Gas Investing TAX ADVANTAGES When it comes to investments for investors, oil and gas investments produce significant tax benefits with the backing of the Domestic energy production offers a litany of tax benefits for investors who can offset “ordinary” or “passive” income Intangible Drilling Costs These costs include everything but the actual well Labor, chemicals, mud, grease and other miscellaneous items necessary for drilling are considered These expenses generally constitute % of the total cost of drilling a well and are % deductible in the year For example, if it costs $300,000 to drill a well, and if it was determined that % of that cost would be considered intangible, the investor would receive a current deduction of $225 Furthermore, it doesn’t matter whether the well actually produces or even strikes Tangible Drilling Costs Tangible costs pertain to the actual direct cost of the equipment installed in and around the well, and it would appear that under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, most types of these tangible equipment are % depreciable in the year placed in Active Passive Income The tax code specifies that a working interest in an oil and gas well is not considered to be a passive activity as long as you do not invest through an entity that limits your This means that net losses can be offset against other forms of income, such as wages, interest, capital gains, provided you have not limited your Small Producer Tax Exemptions This is perhaps the most enticing tax break for small producers and This incentive, which is commonly known as the “depletion allowance”, excludes from taxation % of all gross income from oil and gas wells, subject to the following The percentage depletion deduction is generally limited to the lesser of % of the taxable income before the depletion allowance (Code (d)(1)) or % of the taxable income from the property before the depletion This special advantage is limited solely to small companies and Any company that produces or refines more than ,000 barrels of oil per day is Entities that own more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day, or 6 million cubic feet of gas per day, are excluded as Lease Operating Costs These include lease operating costs, administrative, legal and accounting These expenses are % deductible in the year they are Alternative Minimum Tax All excess intangible drilling costs have been specifically exempted as a “preference item” for those classified as an independent producer on the alternative minimum tax (Generally defined as an individual or entity whose proportionate share is less than 1,000 barrels of oil per day and or six million cubic feet of gas per ) Their AMTI, however, may not be reduced by more than percent of the AMTI that would otherwise be determined if the taxpayer were subject to this intangible drilling cost preference and did not compute an alternative tax net operating loss Developing Energy Infrastructure This list of tax breaks effectively illustrates how serious the government is about developing the domestic energy Perhaps most telling is the fact that there are no income or net worth limitations of any kind for any of them other than what is listed above (i.e. the small producer ) Therefore, even the wealthiest investors could invest directly in oil and gas and receive all of the benefits listed above, as long as they limit their ownership to 1,000 barrels of oil per No other investment category in America can compete with the smorgasbord of tax breaks that are available to the oil and gas Investment Options There are several different avenues available for oil and gas These can be broken down into four major categories: mutual funds, partnerships, royalty interests and working Each has a different level of risk and separate rules for Mutual Funds While this method of investment contains the least amount of risk for the investor, it also does not provide any of the tax benefits listed Investors will pay tax on all dividends and capital gains, just as they would with other Partnerships There are several forms of partnerships that can be used for oil and gas Limited partnerships are the most common, as they limit the liability of the limited partner to the amount of the limited partner’s investment A limited partnership can be structured to provide partners the choice of whether to be a limited partner (subject to the passive loss rules) or a general partner wherein a partner could deduct losses against ordinary The aforementioned tax incentives are available on a The partner will receive a form each year detailing his or her share of the revenue and Royalties This is the compensation received by those who own the minerals where oil and gas wells are This income comes “off
