A vast majority of men's testosterone boosters (and a wide swath of supplements for that matter) include a variety of ingredients that are either under-dosed or proven to be ineffective through research. By creating a supplement for the men's health market using tried and true data, we're breaking the industry mold and giving men something that will not only promote testosterone levels but overall health and well being. The big problem we're addressing is that men's testosterone levels are on a 40 year decline from environmental factors such as over-farming, improper nutrition from fast/junk food, estrogen mimicking chemicals in our food and water supplies, not to mention the everyday pollution from our daily environment and of course, stress. We've seen and understand the research that these testosterone deficiencies can be corrected through supplementation with the right vitamins, minerals, nutrients and ayurvedic herbs. Our formula is built to help men increase their testosterone levels to a maximized normal range, at the top of their body's natural capabilities. Testosterone isn't just for working out at the gym which is a common misconception. There are additional health, psychological & cognitive benefits of higher testosterone.

Upvote,2022-11-01,https://www.goupvote.com,"Des Moines, Iowa, United States",Software,Software,133767.0,"See our future-dated mock press release for the best understanding of Upvote. Voter-turnout at all-time-high as politicians partner with Upvote to better understand their electorate on an issue-by-issue basis. Des Moines, IA – November 5, 2024 Voter turnout among those aged 18 - 35 has reached an all-time high this election cycle, thanks largely to widespread politician partnerships with Upvote. Upvote’s verified information has taken the guesswork out of politics, freeing representatives to act in the best interest of their constituents. Since their inception, Upvote has informed and empowered voters nationwide to instigate change within their political jurisdictions by providing a trusted connection between representatives and their constituents, culminating in a renewed sense of faith in American Institutions. “Before I started using Upvote, I had completely given up on politics,” Shared Nathan P. “I felt like most politicians had a hidden agenda - that they overlooked their constituents in favor of special interests. Now I want to participate because we’re seeing that change is possible.” Upvote transforms the way voters connect with their elected officials by providing a platform that groups, verifies, educates, and empowers them. Their curated, unbiased news feed keeps voters informed and up-to-date on their top policy interests and representatives. Politician ratings give a clear picture of how officials represent important issues. Issue tracking brings plain-language to complex policy and its impact on individuals and their communities. Representative profiles make it easy to understand motivations through campaign finance contributions by special interest, personal investments, voting history by issue, and unbiased bios. Most importantly, verification provides a direct line of communication between voters and their representatives, giving weight to the voice of verified constituents. “I never felt like I actually knew who these politicians were or how their actions matched their words.” shared John H. “I would try to research, but the information was so hard to find and to understand. Now I just check Upvote. Not only do I understand what’s going on, I can see how I’m influencing these outcomes in real-time. It’s addictive.” Beyond serving constituents, Upvote provides a critical service for politicians and their back-office staff. Through their constituent verification mechanism, Upvote has re-architected the public forum to cut through the inherent noise of traditional social media platforms. Officials now know that they’re communicating with real, verified voters in their jurisdiction. They are given a platform to explain their actions and beliefs directly to those that they represent. They are also equipped with granular, proprietary data regarding verified constituent sentiment across all key policy areas. This deep, informed connection allows them to better serve their constituents, and has allowed them to build a reputation through effective service instead of fundraising. “My top priority has always been to effectively serve my constituents, but there was no way for me to stay deeply connected with them at scale.” shared Congressman Brad T. “Aside from town halls and door knocking, it was difficult for me to gather the data-points I needed to serve them on every issue. Now, I check Upvote before every vote on the house floor. My constituents even help me draft language in the bills I bring to subcommittees. The best part is that I’ve gotten so much recognition for my service through Upvote that I don’t need to fundraise nearly as much. I can just focus on serving my community.” Through their platform, Upvote has proven that it is possible to disrupt traditional lobbying and campaign finance, placing democracy’s outcomes back in the hands of the voter.",1-10,1.0,,2023-05-12,50000.0,Debt Financing,50000.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,1,2022,16880,False,False
