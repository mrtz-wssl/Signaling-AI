BitPlus Hosting (BPH) BPH will offer the only known Single-Phase Liquid Immersion Cooling (SLIC) hosting solution available in North America providing its Cryptomining and Data Center customers a competitive advantage through increased equipment efficiencies. The use of immersion cooling, over time we believe it will render current air-cooled technology obsolete.  In providing greater efficiency to our hosted clients BPH experiences superior client retention and will establish itself as an industry leader in both quality and quantity of clients served, both in Cryptomining and Data. In preparation to capitalize on our power build out, BitPlus Hosting intends to acquire current cryptomining hosting and mining companies and convert them to immersion at their facilities or consolidate their operations to our facilities with extremely low electricity costs.  An added benefit to BPH is that profitability in our own mining operations will be superior to traditional mining and hosting companies, see “BitPlus Capital” below.  Our internal mining expertise is magnified with superior low-cost electricity rates. We produce our own electricity, with our own equipment, from surplus natural gas at rates under $0.03/kWh by way of our owned company, Global Northern Resources, LLC. Global Northern Resources, LLC (GNR)  GNR produces large volume, low cost electricity on owned real estate. We then lease space and land, in conjunction with long-term high margin electricity contracts to clients with large megawatt power needs including; Data processing, Data storage, High-tech manufacturing (I.e. plastics & electronics), Gaming, Cryptomining, Vertical Farming, Logistics & Distribution, Warehousing and Multi-use Land Development projects. Low cost power acquisition is a cornerstone for GNR’s immediate and long-term growth.  Our short-term objective will be to produce 250 MW of electricity by year-end 2021, 500 MW of electricity by year-end 2022 and 1,000MW of electricity by year-end 2024.  We currently have 40MW completed in Colorado Springs, CO with an additional 50MW ready for build out.  In Grand Forks, ND we have 30MW completed with an additional 100MW site identified and in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada we have 58MW available for acquisition.  Our 250MW objective in 2021 will be realized upon meeting our funding objectives.   BitPlus Technologies (BPT) BPT is developing a new, disruptive technology for cryptomining.  Our team of computer scientists have vast experience developing the microchips currently used in the most efficient miners available today.  Our goal is to manufacture a miner specifically designed for immersion cooling.  Once completed and in production our miners will use less electricity and produce the highest possible hashrate currently available in cryptomining.   BitPlus Capital (BPC)   BitPlus Holdings, Ltd (BPHL) also mines cryptocurrency for its own portfolio through our investment firm BitPlus Capital (BPC).  The goal of BitPlus Capital is to generate coins, at institutional volume, below market prices greatly enhancing profitability prior to the management of mined coins. BPC has consistently demonstrated an expertise to generate digital currency far below retail market cost.  Collectively, BPHL encompasses electric power supply and real estate through Global Northern Resources, mining and data hosting through BitPlus Hosting, equipment manufacturing through BitPlus Technologies, and portfolio management through BitPlus Capital.

A world with new opportunities for people to evolve and enjoy their lives. A new way of working, investing, creating business and opportunities for all sectors. Let me tell you more about our work: Since the inception of blockchain, we have championed its application across all sectors as Codebooster. What started as an experiment that took place exclusively online is now changing industries and transforming the way they work forever. Blockchain technology was first introduced to the world in 2008. It is known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But blockchain offers more. Much more. We believe blockchain can revolutionize data management by decentralizing information storage, increasing process efficiency and, at the same time, ensuring greater security for everything from IoT (Internet of Things) devices to health records, supply chains and even government agencies. That means we have another step to go. Let me give you an example about our work with this new vision: The cannabis industry's transition to using this revolutionary technology has benefited greatly from our work with them by making it possible to conduct transactions at low cost rather than the high cost and risk of using large amounts of cash. This works through a system where data is automatically shared across devices without any human intervention, ultimately leading to transparency within these markets no longer being compromised thanks in large part to their use of distributed ledger technology: the Orion Project, also known as WID Token, is our vision for this industry, and we are already working with our own cryptocurrency, its own payment gateway and DAPP marketplace. My company has been looking at getting rid of its old concept, because didn't reflect how far the technology had come since its inception. That's why we are rebranding, so the community can see us in a new light: a more modern take on how you all have been operating for years and now it's time to step up our game! We want to show the community that we are all in this together. We need each other's help, and there is no better way to show our gratitude than through a rebranding that reflects our new perspective of life as one big ecosystem, made up of industries (Constellations) and groups within each constellation, which reference different processes within the industry that need to be optimized or changed to increase the quality of life in our communities.

My government responded with brute force to quell the peaceful protests. They used, and continue to use, every means at their disposal to destroy our minds, souls, and bodies. But, their brutality only gave us more reason to continue fighting. WHAT IS MY VISION? Syria must be free from dictatorship and all political detainees must be released.
