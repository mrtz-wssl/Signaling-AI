https://gluon.digital,9440,crunchbase,"Gluon Digital Gluon Blog - Why I Started Gluon Digital Home Our Mission Services About us Blog What is a Gluon? Contact Us Gluon Digital Offical carrier of the Strong Why I Started Gluon Digital Author: David Masri Founder & CEO A bit of background From the moment I decided to change my major to computer information systems (away from finance) I knew I wanted to work with A big part of it was the data processing course I I found a beauty in data theory that was unmatched in my other computer science It may very well be because at the time Baruch College (CUNY) decided to teach Java over C++, which was in its infancy, and the textbook assigned was horrendously full of errors (which could make any new programmer want to cry – there was no Stack overflow to help!). Contrary to the Java textbook, I found the data processing textbook to be brilliantly It is in fact the only one of my college text books I still have (and a quick look online shows that it lasted the test of time, it’s up to the edition !). By the time I joined the Salesforce Ohana (with Redkite in late ) I had spent years working with data and various enterprise systems (ERP, , BI, CRM, Data Warehousing ). I was running a large Salesforce project, for a very large financial services firm, that included a complex data migration component from a CRM The process being used to do this migration seemed to break every rule and best practice I could think But what really caught me by surprise, was that when I questioned the process, I was told “This is how everyone does it, it’s the standard process”. Of course, I didn’t believe that, so I did my own research, low and behold, they were telling the truth, the entire Salesforce community, or at least the ones writing about it online, were following insane data migration I wrapped up that project, and then spent the next year or so completely changing how we (Redkite) did data migrations (and to a lesser, but still substantial extent, integrations). Two years and two acquisitions later, I was running a small team of data experts within Liquidhub Capgemini overseeing all of the data work within the Salesforce Not long after, I joined Silverline and was putting together a training program for the data team based on the patterns and best practices I used to train my team at Capgemini, when I realized I had all the content I needed to fill a book, and then With the encouragement of my manager, I signed a contract with Apress and in December , my book Developing Data Migrations and Integrations with Salesforce: Patterns and Best Practices was A book I felt, and still feel the Salesforce Ohana sorely I had a mission to fix how the Salesforce Ohana works with, and thinks about Gluon Digital is a direct extension of that In fact our mission statement is: To clean up the world s CRM data, by educating the Salesforce Ohana on data best practices, and leading by example to prove those best practices Strong data makes Salesforce Our services are directly related to Our Mission: We educate the Salesforce Ohana on data best practices, by: Sharing knowledge on the Salesforce Data Blog .
