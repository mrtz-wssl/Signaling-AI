How to ask your manager “What is the Priority?” – (and get an answer!) Menu Close Categories Uncategorized The Question Queen How to ask your manager “What is the Priority?” – (and get an answer!) Molly Yanus, Aug Share This Step Don’t! ….. That’s right: Don’t ever ask “What is the Priority?” to your “But how do I know what to work on first?” – “I have too much on my plate!” – “It’s not reasonable ” “It conflicts with this other work I’m doing”….. Exactly! That is exactly why you do not say ""What is the Priority?"" to your You may have heard to never pass problems up to your manager, instead provide recommendations - this is a similar concept . There are many more effective ways to proactively establish the priority and position yourself, and your team, for success without using ""what is the priority?"" as a cop When it comes down to it, there are very few good answers to “What is the priority?” and without all the context, your manager is unlikely to be able to address your real underlying questions concerns. Invest the time to ask a good question and you are much more likely to get an answer that you can run Let us consider alternatives to “What’s the priority?” Is This a higher priority than That ? Should I stop working on This to work on That ? Will it work if I deliver This on This Date , so that I can get That done by That date ? I know that This is important, I could use support from Name to make sure That is complete by That date . I’m concerned about the dependency of This on That . Which do you think should come first? I’ll make sure manager is aware of this new request so that we can prioritize it against this and that and I will get back to you by date with an Does that work? The important component of each of these alternative statements is that you are still driving towards a priority, but you are giving the requester the tools they need to help guide you with the In return you are providing recommendations and articulating potential Don’t get me wrong, understanding the priority of something is critical to you and your team’s Conflicting priorities and lack of alignment between a company’s strategic goals and actual work being focused on is absolutely an issue for many teams! “If it is important to you, you will find a If not, you will find an ” Challenge yourself to be part of the Help drive the priority conversations with specific Manage up when you can and articulate changes to priorities positively to your team so that they feel their work is valued, even when pivots are © Echo Consulting All Rights Reserved | Privacy Policy | Powered by Edgeworks CMS .
