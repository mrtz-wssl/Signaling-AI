Modern Architecture At the same time, web infrastructure has changed for the CDNs are more advanced, serverless functions give unprecendented scale, browsers have new APIs for preloading resources , bundlers and HTTP 2 change the way we approach code And of course, React s component model is incredible even for plain Remix is built to take advantage of it (Re)Discover the Web Remix teaches you the foundational features of the web and then provides simple APIs for you to take advantage of HTTP Caching We run a website called UNPKG .

These mutations are present in most DIPGs and represent an early tumorigenic event . The World Health Organization (WHO) now classifies DIPG and midline gliomas with these mutations together as a distinct pathologic group known as diffuse midline glioma, H3K27 mutant . These mutations appear to set the stage for acquiring additional driver Each tumor may have a unique set of driver mutations that cause the tumor cells to divide and invade normal brain Knowing a tumor’s driver mutations is an important step in selecting treatments that may halt tumor growth .

Interestingly, in the study described above, the blood test results were quantitative and correlated with tumor volume measured by MR The amount of tumor DNA in plasma decreased when the tumor was responding to therapy, and increased when tumors regrew after Imagine not having to wait several months to know if a drug is working or Finding a better and more sensitive way to know that the drug is or isn’t killing tumor cells will help doctors find the best treatment for each Moving liquid biopsy into standard of care ResourcePath partnered with Nazarian’s research laboratory and Ahura Biologics to bring liquid biopsy for diffuse midline glioma into the clinical laboratory ResourcePath took the valuable information learned by Nazarian’s group and others to update and optimize a ddPCR assay to detect minute amounts of tumor DNA in the Initial testing confirmed that tumor DNA harboring H3K27M mutations is detectable in blood in about % of In addition, in a small pilot study with Oncoceutics, Inc , we learned that the quantity of tumor DNA in blood corresponds with response to treatment and size of the tumor as measured by MR Next steps Over the next several months we will be working with Fred Kramer and Diana at the Public Health Research Institute at Rutgers University to maximize the sensitivity of our test and expand the spectrum of mutations the test can detect to include H3F3A G34R V and BRAF V600E .
