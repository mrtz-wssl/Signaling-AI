LinkedIn Pinterest Pinterest IT Staff Augmentation Artificial intelligence (AI) is shaking up the recruiting process, changing the way recruiting agencies and sourcers discover and hire tech AI and machine learning enable professionals to quickly analyze huge amounts of data and make decisions and predictions based on that, said Summer Husband, senior director of data science at Randstad Sourceright, in a presentation at the SourceCon Now, recruiters and sourcers are putting AI to work to help define a job posting’s “perfect fit,” better surface strong candidates from search pools, and improve their ability to fill job openings Shortening up the hiring window Unfilled job postings are a significant drain on organizational To ensure the right recruiting resources are being applied to filling a particular job opening, some sourcers are taking a tip from the healthcare industry’s use of survival In healthcare, survival analysis is a machine learning technique that analyzes time to an event, such as a patient’s expected time before recurrence of a disease or a Here, Husband sees a good analogy to sourcing and recruiting “We take data on jobs we’ve filled for clients in the past, how long those took, how many candidates, open roles, information about the company as well as job market data from sources like the BLS and CareerBuilder, for instance, to find out how all of those things impact the ‘survival rate’ of our open jobs,” Husband “We’re obviously flipping the script, because we want our open jobs to die quickly, but the process is the ” That process allows sourcers to set reasonable expectations for clients and allocate appropriate resources to roles, she “Our goal is that when we see a new [job requisition], we can gather these features right away and we can see whether or not this will be a tough one to fill, and then we can decide whether we should put extra resources toward that now instead of waiting and potentially failing to deliver candidates,” she Accuracy is also important being able to evaluate the precision (the fraction of received information that’s relevant) and recall (the fraction of relevant information that’s received) of algorithms can help sourcing and recruiting professionals make sure they’re delivering the right candidates, she “Sometimes, overall accuracy isn’t the most important In recruiting, it’s okay if you’re missing a few people who might be a good We’d rather that than send a whole bunch of bad results — or inappropriate candidates,” she the ‘perfect fit’ Some recruiters and hiring managers are using AI and machine learning to candidate “fit,” and to predict a potential candidate’s performance in the role, says Chris Nicholson, CEO of artificial intelligence software company “The best use case would be solving the matching problem so that you’re leveraging the tech to find the best candidate for the employer and vice The question everyone’s trying to answer through all the interviews, screenings, tech and coding challenges, is, ‘How can I predict someone’s performance?’ So, the smartest recruiters and hiring managers would start gathering résumés, performance reviews, work product, any information at all about highly successful people that already work for them and plug that into an algorithm to figure out what you are looking for,” Nicholson Ideally, each organization would be able to create algorithms customized for the unique needs of their organizations, taking into account the varying definitions of success, Nicholson “Obviously what makes someone a stellar employee at one company isn’t necessarily going to translate to every other So, it’s a bit like ‘ Moneyball ,’ where you’re looking for specific skills, traits, expertise that will fill in where you are The problem is, most companies are using the wrong ones, and that’s not only hurting them generally, but it also contributes to the lack of diversity and inclusion,” Nicholson “Sure, maybe Stanford degrees, tenure at Google, white, male, been coding since childhood works for some companies, but not only are you excluding hundreds, maybe thousands of people with those parameters, everyone else is chasing those folks, They’re going to be expensive, they’re going to be unavailable, they’re not going to give you the results you need,” Nicholson Balancing recruiting risk AI and machine learning technology also can help determine how and when sourcers and recruiters need help with their workloads by looking at who has a disproportionate share of to requisitions that might take extra time or resources to fill, Husband “When we call something a req, we see that percent of the time those miss their target So, we can see who has a heavier load of these kinds of reqs and then make decisions about what to Do we need to shift these workloads around? Do we need extra sourcers an",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20180819030350/http://www.aifirsttech.com/', 'timestamp': '20180819030350'}",20180819030350.0,1.0
