For several decades we have not seen any innovation from existing search is bringing something brand new to market called We cannot show you images or prototypes of this yet (for obvious reasons), but MultiSearch is an explosion of information unlike anything After using it, you will never be happy again with curated search results from other search engines that are mostly ads, and “what they want you to see”. Just that feature alone will be special because it brings back truly organic search results (something we have not seen in many years). However, what makes Multisearch truly unique is this: We are giving users control of internet search . For example, you can make something we call a FIND ENGINE . Let’s say you like photography… you can make a search results box (or a collection of search results boxes), and have your FIND ENGINE only return results from the sites you want (and specifically block ones you do not want). You can then save your FIND ENGINE , and send to others via texting, email and social So, we’ve now made internet search social (something never accomplished by Google or any other search engine). This is ground Imagine the possibilities … A history teacher who makes a FIND ENGINE of sites they prefer for homework, and sends to their students, companies who build FIND ENGINE around their products and services, researchers scientists around a topic, someone making a comparison between liberal and conservative news to compare bias, or parents making a FIND ENGINE for their children to restrict where they can go on the The possibilities are FIND ENGINE will forever change how you search the web by putting you in complete Yes, we will have a default FIND ENGINE and many people will use this (it is truly spectacular), but creating FIND ENGINES around topics you find interesting is easy, and the public will love it! Add to this that we will never manipulate search results to achieve corporate or personal goals, and the public will have a new powerful way to search the web . Video Posting & Live Streaming FINDS CREATORS will be a great place for anyone to share or livestream video for family and It will be easy and fun to use and have innovative Addtionally, many users build a business on video posting We have been doing round table discussions for about 5 years with Content Creators who have high profile video Many of them have millions of I have carefully listened to FIND CREATORS will be an amazing platform to help them continue to build a great following, and they have agreed that when we launch our platform (because of the features below), they will permanently cut ties with sites like YouTube and bring their audiences to .

Our Carbon Budget works towards the goal of keeping our planet’s temperature from rising more than °C—in line with targets set by the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) .

While Nutrition Facts labels address facts, which are fixed, our Carbon Statements (like bank statements) account for facts and This is an important distinction because our choices and actions over the lifespan of a product increase or decrease the cumulative carbon emissions associated with said This is why we prepare multiple Carbon Statements for the same The Statements will differ, for example, based on whether the consumer chooses to the , or whether the producer chooses to transport the to its point of sale using a vehicle powered by fossil fuels renewable WHAT IS C02e? This is shorthand for “carbon dioxide ” Carbon dioxide (CO₂) overwhelmingly accounts for most greenhouse gas (GHG) Since CO₂ is the most prevalent, other GHGs are converted into the common unit CO₂e using conversion factors based on their global warming potential (GWP) relative to For example, one metric ton of Methane (CH₄) has around the same GWP as thirty metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂), and is therefore represented as This is similar to converting monetary amounts of different currencies into a single base currency in order to compare Check out Carbon Lingo for more!
