System Address Patient and Nursing Safety Issues? Patients who are immobile are at highest risk of developing hospital acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs). Ensuring regular movement or using repositioning redistributes pressure and helps prevent pressure Keeping patients moving is a key component of pressure injury prevention Repositioning is important for patients who are unable to move around easily Nurses need to be competent in the use of devices that help with repositioning (1) Preventing HAPIs can be nursing intensive, and the challenge is even more difficult when there is nursing staff turnover and Studies suggest that HAPI development can be directly affected by the number of registered nurses and time spent at the bedside (2). Patients with HAPIs had significantly higher mortality rates across stages, as well as higher risk of readmissions at , and post hospitalization, compared with patients without HAPI (3). By preventing HAPIs, hospitals have the potential to reduce unreimbursed treatment expenditures, reduce length of stay, minimize readmissions, prevent associated complications, and improve overall outcomes for their patients (3) The System utilizes automated technology to address patient safety related to HAPI The system is designed to automatically turn and reposition patients frequently in order to reduce the risk By using the SAT system, patients are safer as a result of: Automated turning and repositioning patients moving and frequently repositioned as often as every minutes to every 2 hours Ease of use addresses nursing staff competency with the device and ensures that patients are correctly turned and repositioned The automated technology reduces nursing workload burden by serving as a patient turning and repositioning aid, which is especially important in the current climate of high turnover and national staffing shortages The is designed to prevent HAPI, thereby reducing length of stay, minimizing readmissions, preventing associated complications, and improving overall patient References: Fletcher J (2020) Pressure ulcer education 5: keeping patients Nursing Times [online] : 2, Horn, , Buerhaus, , Bergstrom, , & Smout, (2005).

There are several advantages to using frozen donor First, these eggs are typically already frozen, or the donor is scheduled to freeze her eggs in the immediate This allows for a quicker cycle for you, the recipient parent(s). In general, the eggs can be shipped to your clinic and used as quickly as the clinic can schedule your There is no waiting for the donor to be available to cycle, no chance that she won’t get any eggs and no risk that she won’t pass This can save you both time and money as the ​ Additionally, some companies will actually reimburse their employees for the expense of frozen donor This is an advantage to using a fresh egg donor whose services are typically difficult to get And in the case of not having reimbursement, the expense of frozen eggs can be more tailored to your specific For example, many egg banks sell eggs in groups of minimum eggs, and most will allow you to purchase additional eggs a la carte as needed to meet your family In this way, you can purchase only what you will likely A typical egg donor will be predicted to produce greater than eggs with some producing up to Very few recipients will use eggs in their family planning needs, but in the case of a fresh egg donor, you will end up paying for all of those eggs in most If you are hoping to have children, that may be appropriate, but if your goals are only children, then you may benefit from fewer eggs and therefore a less expensive In short, costs per treatment cycle are generally lower using frozen eggs because many of the costs are shared among more than one ​ Finally, many clinics still synchronize the cycle between the fresh egg donor and the recipient While this is not necessary given the vast experience with frozen embryo transfers, if your clinic is choosing to do this, it will require a certain level of coordination between you and the fresh egg Alternatively, your embryo can be frozen after it is made using fresh donor eggs and the embryo can be transferred on a schedule convenient for This is almost always done in cases where the embryo is biopsied and tested genetically prior to embryo transfer (pre-implantation genetic testing). Limitations To Frozen Eggs There are some limitations to frozen eggs as For example, frozen donor egg banks are not required by law to report success rate data to the government the same way as fertility And although individual clinics do report their success rates with frozen donor eggs, there is no way for you, as a patient, to discern that a certain frozen egg bank is producing good quality eggs associated with pregnancy ​ An additional issue is that most frozen egg banks will not provide comprehensive historical data on the past cycles of a frozen egg donor or whether prior frozen eggs from a given donor resulted in This makes it challenging for clinics and patients to have the same confidence in frozen donor eggs as they do in fresh egg donors where this information is readily Currently, according to the SART (Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology) website or the CDC website, the national average for live births using frozen eggs is lower than that of fresh In data from SART from , the live birth rate from frozen eggs was percent, while the rate from fresh eggs was However, this varies significantly from clinic to clinic depending on their individual experience and technical In fact, some programs have reported rates with frozen donor eggs that are equivalent to fresh donor Also, it is reassuring that no difference has been demonstrated in malformations between children born after vitrification of oocytes and those born through IVF in ​ Overall, the added convenience and the lower cycle cost of frozen eggs should be balanced against the lower success rate in some programs and the lower number of eggs available in order to determine the best approach for Choosing the right approach to egg donation is critical to your goals and Working with our team and reproductive endocrinologist in concert with any other members of your fertility team will help you build your family with How We Differ From Other Egg Banks Like many things in fertility, not all egg banks are created Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare costs, guarantees, and donor We believe that certain criteria make us Our egg donors are all physician recruited and screened by our own reproductive Each protocol, egg retrieval and freezing (vitrification) process is handled by the same Eighty percent of our e",startup,None,nan,0.0
