You may be in the Blog by Andy Tryba October , 0 You remember it like Your company’s revenue had Growth had Things that worked before just You were Geoffrey Moore states that your company fell into ‘The Chasm’. In his iconic book ‘Crossing the Chasm’, he describes how the ‘smooth’ Technology Adoption Curve is a bit The Technology Adoption Curve All companies & technologies ride the Rogers Technology Adoption curve . The curve describes the adoption of technology across different market Some customers are willing to be on the ‘bleeding edge’ and others will only adopt a proven This Technology Adoption Curve is broken up into 5 market Innovators – the first to adopt new technologies, they are a small but passionate set of folks that love tech Early Adopters – the second group is a slightly larger group that is also generally and highly adaptable to new They embrace new products after the Early Majority – the third group is a much larger group that is a bit more careful than the previous 2 They are still willing to adopt new technologies – but only after the Early Adopter and Innovators have proven the technology to be Late Majority – the fourth group is a conservative and They need a bit of convincing before investing in something Laggards – the last group is an extremely frugal, very conservative and These folks still have rotary dial The Chasm Moore states that there is a ‘chasm’ between the Early Adopters and the Early This is due to the fact that the expectations of the first 2 groups are very different than the last To effectively ‘Cross the Chasm’ – companies need to ‘pivot’ their product offerings to address the mainstream A ‘whole product’ is required for a technology to cross the chasm into the mainstream of the For those companies that do manage to get across the chasm – good days are typically in the The company is now into the ‘Early Majority’ – which is a much larger part of the Often times, the company will double or triple in revenue with strong Awesome… But what happens after that? When you relook at the Technology Adoption Curve – and zoom at the top of the curve – you notice something As you climb up the Early Majority, the slope of the curve starts to It then eventually becomes flat! In business terms – this means the awesome revenue growth that you experienced after crossing the chasm starts to It then completely This stall comes out of nowhere – since you’ve been experiencing great growth over the past several And as time goes on, unfortunately, revenue then starts to According to ScaleVP – you can predict this growth After analyzing thousands of SaaS companies – the ‘predictable decay’ of next year’s growth will be % of this year’s And for many software companies – growth under % per year results in only an 8% chance of surviving a few more years ( SaaS sales benchmark ) But I thought this was supposed to be the good ole’ times? You worked hard to cross Geoffrey Moore’s chasm – what’s going on here??? The 2 nd Chasm What’s happening here is actually an important missing part of Moore’s Believe it or not – there are actually 2 chasms! Wait – what? The first chasm gets startups to the mainstream For many software companies – revenues go from $0 to $3-5m a Getting to millions a year in revenue is incredibly But as predicted by the adoption curve and predictable decay – revenue growth gets harder and harder every Deals that appear to be ‘just around the corner’ delay The technical debt on your product expands while your next generation product just can’t seem to Your investor’s IPO dreams are being Your employees are starting to wonder if this rocket ship isn’t going to pay for their future yacht after You’re now in the 2 nd By definition – the 2 nd Chasm is a bit further in a company’s Revenues have often grown to $8-$10m year – but have been hovering at that level for several And similar to the first chasm, companies require significant changes to get across this new chasm to regain But unfortunately – this 2 nd Chasm is much much harder to exit than the Why is it harder to cross the 2 nd Chasm? Companies that fall into the 2 nd Chasm have often been in business for They’ve done a great job getting across the first chasm and addressing a portion of the mainstream But crossing the 2 nd Chasm is harder than the first due 3 primary reasons: Company processes are more established and rigid: Think of these companies as middle Not quite as nimble or flexible as they were when they were a few years And as a result, the process and procedures that have been in place for a decade are now incredibly hard to Product development has been going on for years: You’d think that the more ‘mature’ product would be better equipped to handle But more often than not – since the product was originally built years ago – it",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20201101123141/https://www.ionicpartners.com/', 'timestamp': '20201101123141'}",20201101123141.0,1.0
