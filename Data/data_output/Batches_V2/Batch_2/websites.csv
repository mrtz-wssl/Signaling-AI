It can drive 2-2.5% improvement via identifiable source of data, non-tampered documents and cost-reduction (& improved cash flows by 25-60 days) due to avoidance of repeated validation of same documents as loans change hands from origination to securitization.  Mortgage origination is highly inefficient as it changes hands from originator/broker, to the warehousing bank, to investors, the servicers, to the agencies (Freddie/Fannie) & increasingly the Hedge Funds. The same mortgage documents are subject to repeated appraisals, underwriting and validations due to lack of security, trust in the system, and inadequate understanding of exact composition of loans. This entails duplicative costs, stuck cash-flows and a system based on distrust across the chain. Moreover,  homes gets refinanced every 3.6years (av.) but only 18% of borrowers go to the same lender  - poor customer retention across entire home-mortgage ecosystem. We run the entire loan origination documentation on blockchain making the platform the source of immutable & undeniable provenance for all mortgage documents. This  makes the loan process quicker & easier with improved borrower retention by 3X,  reduces time of closure on refinance, reduces duplicative costs and releases cash-flows for lenders in selling their loans to the investors, who in turn can convert loan pools faster and cheaper into mortgage backed securities (MBS),  traded by secondary market players.

In 2015 Baltimore, Maryland-based federal contractor Tidewater, Inc  was looking for an automation solution to help them manage 650 vendors and thousands of monthly invoices. After researching products in the market, they realized that most were just too big, too expensive, or put far too much burden of implementation on their small AP team. They wanted a solution that would not only help them to stem the growth of their AP department, but something that would enhance communication with their vendors. Prasad Dissanayake, President of Tidewater and engineer by profession, tapped friend and software engineer, Dimuthu Roshan, in Sri Lanka to recruit a development team to build what would eventually become PaperTrl. In less than one year the software transformed the Tidewater AP function. Payback came quickly as Tidewater saw huge increases in AP efficiencies. Due to its popularity among users and vendors, Tidewater decided to commercialize PaperTrl. Prasad chose software industry veteran Steve Weber as CEO. Steve had spent most of his career leading software companies that were focused on developing, marketing and supporting integration solutions for ERP and accounting software. As such he came with many years’ experience in the Intuit, SAGE, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, and SAP communities. Shilpa Marano joined the team as COO having worked with Steve at integration startup nChannel and IBM Sterling Commerce. Shilpa brought years of experience building successful marketing and product teams. Together with Dimuthu now serving as CIO, Steve and Shilpa were able to direct PaperTrl’s functionality to address an area of the market that was being underserved – specifically, an easy to implement, easy to use, but highly functional AP automation solution at an affordable price.",11-50,1.0,Seed,2023-05-01,,Seed,,2.0,11-50,Private,,,,,,2,2018,26504,False,False

Someone once said that an idea can change the world, and while at first it is hard to imagine the magnitude of what each person can achieve with their actions, one must always take the first step to make them a reality. At ezFrontiers we want to change the world, but the world of the entrepreneurs, and let them through their ideas make this world a better place for all of us. That is why we want everyone to know that to become an entrepreneur you don't need great things, just a great idea. We know that starting a business is possible for everyone who has the initiative, wherever they live, and that is what we seek to communicate. But not only that, which we do by training entrepreneurs through the content we publish on our various digital platforms, but we also seek to put it into practice. It's very easy to say that everything is simple, but to say it with foundation is something else very different. Thus, through the creation of companies in the United States, we seek to help entrepreneurs from all over the world, especially Spanish-speaking ones, to effectively carry out their projects, supporting them with the required procedures. For many it is complex, and we do not want bureaucratic obstacles to ruin an idea that, perhaps, can change the world. It's a first step, the rest is up to them, but we want to be there to do our bit. It is said that when undertaking the most important thing is to start, and we are very clear about that, because when we started this project, ezFrontiers, we also went through that stage. Creating a company for many sounds like something that is only reserved for executives with a tie or people with a lot of money who are in an office at the top of a building full of glass panels that make it look elegant, but no. On a day-to-day basis, SMEs are the drivers of every country's economy, they are the engine that generates jobs and changes the lives of millions of people. That is why we are motivated to liberalize the creation of companies, to make every entrepreneur see that there are no obstacles to start a business. That it does not matter their nationality, profession or way of thinking, because anyone, as long as they are over 18, can create a company to bring their ideas to life. And not only that, but working for them, because that is another issue that motivates us, working for oneself.",1-10,,,,,,,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,2020,36414,False,False
