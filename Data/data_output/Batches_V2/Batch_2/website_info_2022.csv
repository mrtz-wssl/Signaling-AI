In some countries, such as Germany, hardware removal is a more common occurrence because the national healthcare system reimburses for the procedures, adding costs to the healthcare system from both the procedure and management of the In the US, where removal is less common at an overall rate of % of the million orthopedic fixation procedures occurring annually, this translates to an estimated direct cost of $1.72 billion per year with an average cost of $11,800 per procedure [2] , [3] , [4] . Indirect costs resulting from an average of days of time away from school or work further increase the costs t o society [5] . Absorbable polymer implant technology was introduced to eliminate these costs, and after several decades has had limited market penetration due to its shortcomings in usability and unique Removal rates of polymer implants are comparable to Titanium due to unique complications arising from the polymeric absorption process [6] . Despite their complication rates, polymer absorbable hardware is used in over % of craniomaxillofacial fixation procedures, demonstrating a strong market demand for absorbable To solve the problems of current implant material technology, Magsorbeo Biomedical has partnered with Terves , a leading developer and manufacturer of proprietary magnesium alloys, to develop the next generation of bioabsorbable metal implants, starting with maxillofacial fixation utilizing the Akesorb System . Our approach to bioabsorbable alloy development is differentiated by focusing on highly biocompatible alloys with tailored and absorption profiles to match the needs of a particular Competing alloy technology degrades unpredictably and is either too fast or too slow in reaching full Furthermore, these competing alloys cannot be easily adapted to meet the unique needs and varying implant size requirements of other specific Implants degrading too fast or unpredictably can pose a safety risk to the patient when they lose mechanical integrity too early, and implants degrading too slow minimize the benefits of absorbable implant technology and may increase risk of complications . Through our Joint Development Program with Terves, Magsorbeo Biomedical aims to improve the quality of life with our bioabsorbable implant technology, reducing surgical interventions and healthcare [1] Hanson J, Lovald S, Cowgill I, Erdman M, Diamond National hardware removal rate associated with internal fixation of facial J Oral Maxillofac Apr 69(4) doi: j.joms.2010.05.029.
