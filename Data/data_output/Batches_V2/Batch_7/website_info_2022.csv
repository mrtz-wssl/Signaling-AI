The jhanas are a series of highly pleasurable altered states of They appear in both Buddhism and Hinduism (under different spelling), and appear similar to states described in other mystical traditions, including Christianity, Mormonism, and Depending on the context, they’re used for different purposes, ranging from a direct route Enlightenment to a warmup exercise for other Newcomers to jhanas also frequently use it as a launchpad to explore other contemplative and ethical Why would I want to learn the jhanas? The jhanas are profoundly blissful and can have cascading positive effects, like a “mentality of abundance,” and make it easier to engage in Practitioners often use hyperbolic terms, such as “life-changing,” “better than sex,” and “they completely absolved me of the notion that happiness comes from outside ” Preliminary brain images support these descriptions, suggesting jhana meditators have learned to turn on the pleasure centers in their brain without external One of our favorite jhana practitioner quotes is “Why would I have a second piece of chocolate cake when I know I can beat that by in minutes with my eyes closed?” Learning the jhanas also looks excitingly tractable — for a long time jhana practice was thought to be limited to monastics, but in the last years jhana practice has been rapidly New evidence and schools of thought suggest anyone can learn these Are you injecting energy into the brain? Neurofeedback is an effective, , safe, , and intervention regularly used by clinical psychologists and in consumer We are not inducing states via something like current or We monitor brainwaves and then give audio, visual, or haptic feedback to let the user know they’re on the right This serves like a map in unfamiliar territory, but you do the walking and develop the relevant muscles How does neurofeedback help? In some ways it’s easier to imitate Lebron James than it is the Dalai Because meditation is invisible and preverbal, words are a limited tool for describing our inner experiences, and learning to meditate involves lots of guesswork and imprecise Individualized and realtime feedback based on brainwaves can give faster and more precise feedback, improving motivation and If you have direct access to pleasure, could you become addicted? Jhana meditators show no sign of On the contrary, practitioners often report positive changes in other cravings and Some Buddhist meditation circles use the term “jhana junkie,” but in a very specific In these circles, the jhanas are used as warmup exercises for practices that lead to desirable, “Insights.” The term “jhana junkie” refers to someone that only practices the jhana and never moves One teacher likes to say “it’s very easy to cure a ‘jhana junkie,’ you just have to show them the value of ” Since good meditation requires hard work, isn t this scheme doomed to fail? We don’t want to swap what the Buddhist’s call “right effort” for instant But “hard work” can also mask poor pedagogy and stagnant Access to the jhanas can have profound mental health benefits, increase motivation and ability for other forms of contemplative practice, and cascade into relationships and We believe in helping people access these states in ways that are accessible, safe, and Will focusing on specific states increase striving, which is what meditation is designed to prevent? There’s a paradox in meditation between the method, which hinges upon “letting go” and the objective, which rests on a clear In the same way that teachers correct practice via instruction, we hope our feedback will help users learn how to navigate this paradox more effectively, not Does the use of technology taint or nullify the spiritual benefit of jhana practice? At one point singing bowls were cutting edge Meditation teachers have been providing neurofeedback for millennia, and many more technologies and techniques from retreats to chanting have carried the jhanas through time and EEG and ML algorithms are new tools of our age, and we hope will be equally treasured contributions to jhana practice in the Are you divorcing jhanas from their ethical context, and risking morality in the process?
