The cessation of LIBOR represents a significant challenge for the Navigating this transition will affect firms in many The needs to understand that they now have a new risk in their portfolios – the fallback language in their Although the Fed is pushing for firms to convert their USD LIBOR positions to SOFR before the end of , there are many complicating LIBOR fallback language is highly inconsistent from one deal to the Even if a deal has fallback language for temporary disruptions in the setting of LIBOR, many do not anticipate a permanent This creates unintended consequences, including fallbacks that effectively turn a floating rate note to fixed at the last LIBOR setting if there are no banks willing to set a LIBOR Given the historically low level of LIBOR, this disincentivizes issuers to alter their fallback Another potential landmine for the is that some states require % consent in order to modify a This means that a single investor could hold up the conversion of a deal to an alternative reference rate if they do not give their consent to the new This is already happening 1 and has the potential to create a wave of litigation throughout the The cessation of LIBOR does not only affect certain parts of a It affects the entire organization – portfolio management, trading, marketing, operations, technology, risk management, The entire organization needs to be engaged in the process through a governance structure established by senior 1 See “CLO Libor fallback language proposal fails as investor balks at change” , https: www.reuters.com article clo-liborammcrefi clo-libor-fallback-language-proposal-fails-as-investor-balks-at-change-idUSL2N26S16P , Reuters, October 8, What should firms be focusing on now to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR? At this phase of the transition process we would advise firms to do the following: Establish a proper governance structure that will educate and empower the entire firm to deal with the LIBOR Identify and evaluate your firm’s LIBOR fallback Firm’s typically have a solid grasp on the basic details of their floating rate instruments – reset dates, maturity, spread, credit quality, However, when it comes to the LIBOR fallback language embedded in documents many firms do not know what will happen to deals if LIBOR fails to Understanding fallback risk is no easy task if a firm has thousands of deals tied to We recommend getting a handle on LIBOR fallback risk as soon as possible to identify problematic deals before they lose Investors may opt to sell rather than take the risk of an unfavorable outcome if LIBOR doesn’t Attempting to tackle the entire transition all at once is not Breaking the process down into discrete phases will help firms manage this very complex Create a plan that includes milestones and hold people accountable for meeting At this stage firms should not focus too much on the ultimate replacement SOFR is most likely going to be the alternative reference rate that many contracts convert to, but there is planty of time to focus on this after setting up a proper governance structure, identifying fallback risk and formulating a transition Market Alpha Advisors can help firms through every stage of the transition so do not hesitate to reach out if you need What can firms do now to address their LIBOR exposure in cash instruments (Bank Loans, Floating Rate Notes, MBS, ABS, Securitized Products, ) as part of their plan to transition away from LIBOR? As mentioned above, the first step is identifying the fallback risk embedded in The most important thing that a firm can do at this point is to generate a LIBOR Fallback Report like the one shown Once that task is completed they can then sort, categorize and evaluate their Sample LIBOR Fallback Report As you can see, the fallback language embedded in",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20200813063936/https://mktalpha.com/', 'timestamp': '20200813063936'}",20200813063936.0,1.0
