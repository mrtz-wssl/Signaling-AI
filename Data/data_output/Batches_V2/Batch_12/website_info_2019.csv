Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to neutralize and remove foreign substances through recognition of antigens the antibody’s unique molecular Most therapeutic mAbs share similar composition with naturally occurring antibodies, however, mAbs have limitations, primarily due to the antibody’s large The issue of size makes certain targets inaccessible and prevents efficient penetration into solid tumors or sites of uncontrolled infection and Abound Bio’s Unique Approach: Our team has developed several very large ( 10 clones each), diverse human antibody libraries in standard Fab and scFv, and unique VH domain We can rapidly (days to weeks) discover novel, high affinity, binders in multiple formats, engineer them if needed to improve their drugability (developability), and convert them for multiple uses including IgGs, multispecific, CARs, fusion proteins and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).

HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of It is a series of regulatory standards that monitor the accessibility and lawful distribution of protected health information (PHI). HIPAA compliance is regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
