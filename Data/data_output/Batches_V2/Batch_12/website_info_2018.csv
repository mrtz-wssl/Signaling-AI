Adaptogens are the wellness industry’s latest buzzword - adaptogenic lattes are popping up in salad bars and blends are finding their home on the shelves of Some adaptogens like ashwagandha, can be taken in a powdered While others, like Lion’s Mane mushroom, can be a nice dinnertime side So, what are they? Adaptogens are a category of herbs and mushrooms that help balance your body’s reaction to stress by modulating it’s hormonal and physiological Adaptogens improve adrenal function, protect you from disease, boost immune function and improve overall [1].

Not to mention your body will be feeling all sorts of other effects like enhanced immune regulation and less inflammation [4] . So, while cordyceps can help with physical stressors like muscle fatigue, it can also help with biological stressors by enhancing immune See how adaptogens can be?

Starting that new job has knocked you out of equilibrium and, as a person with sudden external stress, you are more susceptible to disorders such as gastric ulcers, weight gain, and To qualify as an adaptogen, an herb or mushroom must help your body resist disorders like Must not harm the An adaptogen cannot have any side effects, or do anything that might mess with your body’s normal Further Reading + References: What Are Adaptogens and Why Are People Taking Them?

From there, we recommend Amy Yasko’s book, Feel Good Nutrigenomics , as a good resource to begin learning how your genetics should influence Now on to Genetics , and everything about genes you forgot from high The code within your cells Our body is made up of roughly trillion cells, all with specialized functions, creating the diverse range of tissues and organs required to make a Within each cell, in a structure known as the nucleus , we have pairs of chromosomes (hence the name of ), which is chromosomes in These pairs of chromosomes are inherited from your parents, one from your mother and one from your The sex chromosome pair determine whether you are male (XY) or female (XX). While the other pairs of chromosomes are known as autosomes . Each chromosome is composed of tightly packed chromatin this is a structure made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acids), wrapped around proteins known as The DNA molecule consists of two strands which wind around each other to form a double helix ‘twisted ladder’ The sides of the ladder are made up of sugars and phosphates while the ‘rungs’ of the DNA ladder are pairs of nucleic acids, known as base pairs . There are four types of bases in DNA adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). The bases pair in a specific way A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with So how does DNA provide the instructions to make us? The genetic code is formed from the bases along one strand of the DNA molecule, known as the DNA The DNA sequence is broken up into genes , units of the DNA sequence which provide the instructions for making The complete set of human DNA (3 billion base pairs!), including all genes, is known as the genome . The bases A, T, C and G are the ‘letters’ of the DNA sequence, with each group of three letters forming a ‘word’ known as a Each codon is associated with a specific amino acid , as the codons are ‘read’ along the DNA strand, the specific amino acid is added to a growing chain which, once complete, forms a Proteins are the building blocks of life they form the components of every one of those trillion cells as well as acting in a whole host of processes that keep us Patterns of Inheritance As we have previously discussed, we inherit half our genetic code from our mother and half from our Therefore, at every position in our genome we have two alleles (forms of the gene), one inherited from each The genotype is the combination of alleles we have The alleles may be the same ( homozygous ) or different ( heterozygous ) forms of a gene and can be dominant or recessive in the way the gene is expressed as a characteristic, known as the phenotype . Autosomal Dominant An allele is described as autosomal dominant when only one copy is required to display the phenotype associated with the gene on an autosome . The associated phenotype will be present whether the individual is heterozygous or homozygous for the Autosomal Recessive An allele is described as autosomal recessive when two copies are required to display the phenotype associated with the gene on an autosome . The associated phenotype will be present only when the individual is homozygous for the Individuals who are heterozygous for the autosomal recessive allele are described as a carrier , they will not display the phenotype but can pass the allele onto their The X chromosome contains many genes, including those not related to sex While the Y chromosome does Therefore, genes on the X chromosome required by both sexes display a characteristic inheritance pattern described as , or Females, with two X chromosomes, have two copies of each gene and can therefore be heterozygous or homozygous for an Males, with one X and one Y chromosome, express all the alleles present on their only X chromosome (which they receive from their mother) and are described as hemizygous for that It’s all in the name – How variants are described If you have delved into the world of genetic testing, knowing your bases from your amino acids is pretty important in understanding what your results mean for your genetic code, especially when reading scientific Ready to dive in?
