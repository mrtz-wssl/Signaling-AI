What’s the problem? There are many ways to play, many perspectives on games, and many definitions of “good”. Part of what makes online games so great is playing with other people! Today, however, players are overwhelmingly telling us that they’re frustrated by how often games are disrupted, for example by on the same teams, or by harassment and Can you give some examples of what problems you’re tackling? Games can be disrupted in many ways through gameplay, exploits, cheating, misaligned goals, harassment, For example, sometimes different expectations arise about how the match should go, such as one player expecting a casual match, while another expects an intense Sometimes it’s the frustration that games can We can help find better ways to match players together who have the same goals, which improves the match and reduces the chance that you’re going to have a bad We can also help by looking for ways to lessen unnecessary friction through And there are many more We want people to enjoy playing our games, so we are also as much (if not more!) about encouraging positive play as we are about discouraging negative Why aren’t you calling this “toxicity”? “Toxicity” is an ambiguous term: it’s OK casually (we’ll use it from time to time), but it doesn’t help us accurately address the problem, which is that players feel their games are disrupted by other players too Sometimes those disruptions come about innocently (i.e. not “toxic” or with no ), sometimes they’re completely our fault because of game design or mismatched players, and sometimes it’s a player behaving way over the line, We find that “disruptive behaviour” better represents what we’re focusing on, without being too about individual expression or unfairly lumping players We want you to feel that you’re playing the matches you want to play, free of Is this all about making everyone nice on the internet? For the most part, there’s plenty room to still be ourselves, and that includes banter and trash talk where and when What we say to our friends will impact total strangers differently, particularly with the distance, lack of human signals, and pressures that can come along with communication in We hope to make interactions between players more productive not just through a better understanding of human nature, but also through game design, level design, matchmaking, and Is the goal to create a universal code of conduct? Games, communities, and individuals are all very diverse, and one blanket policy can’t cover everything without harming games in We don’t want to dictate how games should be Some games work better with cohesive, teams, some games work better with a bit more How each member chooses to apply our resources or learnings is up to What about hate and hate speech? We’re not OK with Players don’t have to like one another, but we all agree that a base level of respect is needed in Hate is not the same as frustration or banter it is cruel and That doesn’t mean that trash talk is automatically out, either -- each game will be different and will depend on the But I’m just playing with my friends! For the most part, we don’t want to change how you play games with your friends, we want to make sure that games with strangers are just as Is there really a problem?
