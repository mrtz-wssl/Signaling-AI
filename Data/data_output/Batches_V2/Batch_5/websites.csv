VISION  'Chasing' the Wind vision is to bend curves, bridge divides, eradicate IT gates; fighting the corporatocratic climate that has placed more emphasis on sub-optimal optimization and bottom-line profitability than empowering employees and providing total customer satisfaction through continuous improvement and quality management principles. CORE VALUES  'Chasing' the Wind core values are forged in America's Founding Documents; especially the preamble to & Declaration of Independence; alongside earth's Wisdom Literature, to bring US once again— under God with Liberty and Justice for all.

Employer Employee loyalty is no longer in existence.  Wealth gaps widen.  IT and digital skills gaps are getting ignored.  Systemic rot sits top-down.  While sustainability gets tossed around as a now trending keyword. And the elderly are getting abused by database con-artists, family members, and entitled neighbors.  with Wind works tirelessly at:  - Bending curves. - Closing gaps. - Bridging divides.  - Eradicating gates, and  - Fighting systemic issues driven by corruption, kickbacks, bureaucracy, and hypocrisy.

This trend in turn leads to an increase in the number of people requiring long-term skilled care (LTSC), which includes home care, hospices, nursing homes, and assisted living centers. One of the most common issues in LTSC settings is falls. One in every 3 people older than 65 years is estimated to fall 1 or more times each year. Fall death rates among adults age 65 and older increased more than 30% from 2007 to 2016. Every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall. Falls in older adults are not only risky, but also costly. In 2019, falls of US residents aged 65 or older led to $51B in medical costs, with $39B paid for by Medicare/Medicaid and $12B paid by private entities. Falls are also the 2nd largest reason for lawsuits against LTSCs. Heron Point Tech’s Fall Prevention System allows assisted living facilities to preemptively and continuously detect residents who are likely to fall. As opposed to most fall-related systems, our system doesn’t detect falls - it stops them from happening in the first place. By using our camera-based system to track resident walking patterns/gaits, residents are assigned weekly fall risk scores.

Data on blockchain though is extremely noisy, hard to read and even harder to make sense of them. Openstory was created in order to organize and democratize the access of blockchain data so users can make educated decisions, based on information and knowledge that before was only available to highly technical funds and companies. What’s happening on-chain Openstory is not a siloed API aggregator, a hand-picked catalog, or a centralized recommendation web2 service. Openstory is an indexer that focuses on scanning and unveiling on-chain truth like a story so everyone can easily make decisions based on objective information. What you see in the platform is not a recommendation from an employee or the curated information of APIs; instead, our database starts and ends with indexing the public on-chain information, offering a pure outcome of how people use and interact with web3. How challenging is this? Mapping web3 is both a data intelligence challenge and a UX challenge. How do we display the information meaningfully and drive usage beyond? How deep do we go? Your feedback is essential to its success, so we'd love you to be part of this journey early on. How to use Openstory The initial token/NFT sale can be the beginning of the experience, not the end. A creator or a brand can use Openstory to see how web3 users use/interact with their creations, spot their audience (who is buying and what’s their engagement) and reward them accordingly. A collector can use Openstory to assess if an NFT is worth buying based on usage/investors attracted, discover the up-and-coming collections, meet other collectors/soulmates, and create deeper relationships with the artists they love. A flipper can discover the most recent collections that grow exponentially. Everyone can check key market metrics, e.g., active users in the market, market growth, and marketplaces with the highest traction, so they have a better picture of the market they invest their money and time.",1-10,,M&A,,,,,4.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,5,2021,27403,False,False

We believe that the CRM of the future is relationship-centric and should be built on top of a different set of assumptions: - It should be about relationships, not sales pipelines. Focus and priority are on the relationship with the person or organization. - It should encourage you to stay in touch with your valuable relationships. - It should not require an army of consultants to get started. It should be user-friendly and straightforward to use. - Relationships don't happen when you sit behind the computer. So big attention is on mobile experience of the user. - It is not for the sales department only. Other teams hold important relationships in the business and will also be using the tool.
