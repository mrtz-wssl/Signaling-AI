To put it simply, Prompts are Someone from the community can ask a book related question and anyone can answer Here’s an example with the question “ What were your favorite childhood books? “: The prompt of the week Once someone asks this question, anyone can go in an answer Once you’re logged in, you can answer this prompt with any number of Whether one book comes to mind or a hundred, you can fill those By default, the answer form will filter for only books you’ve marked as “read” on Hardcover (notice the little “Only show books you’ve finished” checkbox). This is helpful if you’re already tracking all of your books on Hardcover and want to see limited search Add your answers to this Once you’ve selected a book as an answer to this prompt, you have the option to write This will show up for anyone who looks into why this book is an Redwall is the first book that got me excited about Your answers to this will show up on the All Answers page for the prompt, but also on a page within your profile . You can link back to just your answers to this prompt if you want to share it, or check out someone elses prompt My answers to this question as shown on my By collecting a bunch of answers to this prompt from the community, Hardcover is able to see which books are answered the most This means we can show the top results from the across the In this case we’ve only just launched the Prompts, so there are only 3 readers so far (from those of us working on Hardcover). As more readers fill out their answers the overview will The overall results shows the top most answered books for this What’s most exciting about this to me is that this will be useful tomorrow, a year from now and For those who want a deeper dive into the answers, they can head over to the Books tab and see the top There are always people looking for answers to this question, and the community as a whole can help people find an answer in a way that an algorithm can’t. This is just the beginning of prompts right We have a bunch of ideas on what to do Show the most common answers in the last years? In the last year? Books written by women? By POC? By LGBTQ+ authors? What about showcasing peoples explanations of why they added a book in more places across the site? Today we’re launching Prompts! Each week we’ll have a new Prompt of the Week that shows up at the top of the Prompts page .

Adam Fortuna By Adam Fortuna 9 2021, 8:04:33 PM · 3 min read After a bunch of discussions with users we have an idea on what the social side of Hardcover will Want a sneak peak? So, is Hardcover a Social Network? Yes – or at least it can We’re building Hardcover with three different social options for you to choose from: Public – Your account is completely Anyone can see what books you’ve read, are reading, lists you create and activity on the Followers Only – Only people you follow can see your activity on Private – No one can view your You’re effectively a You can still follow people and see what they’re reading (if they let you), but no one will be able to see what you do on These settings will also be available at an individual book or list level . If you’re reading a book you don’t want to show off publicly, you can mark it as private and no one is the (Side note: When it was crazy popular I read “50 Shades of Gray” but didn’t track it on On Hardcover I’d track it as a “followers only” book). This is a similar social approach to Twitter, Instagram and This isn’t a friendship like Facebook, but a follower model where anyone can follow anyone and see their public activity (or followers only activity if that user follows you). We’re building a second setting as well that determines who can interact with your activity on the You may decide to have a public account, but only allow comments and likes from your followers (or disable that altogether).
