Check it out on Github! Documentation View on Github Embiggen Embiggen (MBGN) is the ERC20 token that grows in your wallet! It offers a way to introduce new currency by providing it to all MBGN holders at once, proportionally to the amount of MBGN they hold (at a rate of % per annum, compounded hourly). You can think of it like a stock split the total supply of the token is increased while each holder s share of the pie stays the same View Contract Claim Embiggen! NotCoin NotCoin is an ERC20 token that enables ""one-sided"" In otherwords, if you want to use an exchange contract to offer a token (such as Embiggen) without asking for a different token in return, NotCoin gets the job OpenRelay invented NotCoin to facilitate the Embiggen Airdrop, because we literally wanted to give away Hypothetically though, it could be used in any exchange where a token is being offered in exchange for something other than a token (like payment via fiat currency, for example).

Fling! Fling is a dApp for sending tokens to a lot of different addresses at once in just two The smart contract powering Fling was originally created to help us prepare for the Embiggen Airdrop, but after others expressed interest in a interface to the contract s functionality, we created the Fling More a love letter to the Ethereum community than a product, Fling demonstrates what is possible when clever smart contracts meet (Also, it has a pretty sweet trebuchet ) Blog Post Try it out!

Shared doesn t seem very good, does it? Well, that s what it is referred to as: shared The good thing here is that the web space hosting accounts furnished by Ware Geeks Web Services are powered by an devised, futuristic cloud web hosting solution (each web hosting service, such as electronic mail, databases, CP, disk space, DNS, stats, and so on, runs on an independent group of web servers in a cluster). This is a circumstance ANY cPanel web hosting firm on the Earth will have considerable predicaments with, since cPanel is a based webspace hosting environment (each web hosting service, such as electronic mail, databases, website hosting Control Panel, data storage, DNS, stats, and so on, runs on a single web server), cPanel is not open source (hence the cPanel webspace hosting companies are unable to add extra functionality and manipulate it the way they need it) and there is no open source file platform (they must construct their own file system), which is the premise of any cloud web hosting service . Let s return to the shared webspace hosting plans, which are powered by a real clustered web hosting With a shared site hosting account, each customer pays only for his her package, thus retaining the web space hosting price really low (since many clients are hosted on one and the same server). In brief, a shared hosting account, which is hosted on a cloud web space hosting platform, permits you to pay just for the resources that you actually require, precluding a situation where you pay for a web space hosting plan that you cannot truly utilize, or for a tiny web hosting plan that cannot handle your web The possibility to upgrade your account from one package to another with only two clicks of the mouse grants you the flexibility to kick off with a tiny plan and upgrade as your Internet presence In this way, you save money that you can invest in advertising the web site while it is still brand Each and every web hosting plan provided by Ware Geeks Web Services sports an online site builder and over forty popular script platforms among them WordPress, Joomla, Zen Cart and Moodle that will save you of dollars for website design Ware Geeks Web Services supplies shared web site hosting services in several different countries across the There is one data center in Chicago covering the US and Canada two European datacenters - in the Unit",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20170921072452/http://waregeeks.com/', 'timestamp': '20170921072452'}",20170921072452.0,1.0

While on tour, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to perform live acoustic music for some sick children at Miller Children’s Hospital in Long Beach, These kids didn’t really know the BOSTON catalog, but they nonetheless truly seemed to appreciate the vibe and spirit of the music, and the fact that the performer was singing to them .
