A: The CO 2 (carbon dioxide) in the kelp is absorbed during the growth cycle from the ocean surface That CO 2 in the ocean was absorbed from the So when fuel is burned, the CO 2 emitted only replaces CO 2 that was absorbed by the farms a few months previously, making a (For further explanation, see discussion below on the Water Cycle, the Carbon Cycle and Fossil ) Q: Is there a way for ocean farming to sequester CO2 out of the atmosphere? A: Once ocean farming of kelp has replaced all use, then we might want to intentionally “sink” farmed kelp to the ocean bottom over subduction zones (trenches on the ocean bottom) where the tectonic plates will carry the kelp deep under the crust of the Earth, removing the CO 2 from the biosphere for geologic This could also be done as part of the “last voyage” of each farm when it is at , so that each farm contributes to the cycle during its normal life and also contributes to removing fossil carbon out of the atmosphere at Discussion Water Cycle: Consider the water cycle often taught as part of grade school The sun evaporates water out of the ocean into the clouds and clouds drift over the The clouds then rain over the mountains and The water eventually make its way downstream and back into the ocean where it is once again evaporated, and the water cycle Carbon Cycle (see Fossil Carbon below): The carbon cycle is a similar cycle to the water The carbon is absorbed by plants and trees from the If people (consider the early pioneers) cut down the trees and burned them for heat, the carbon is released into the atmosphere where it is absorbed by the trees Eventually those same trees might be cut down again for Or the trees may live a full life, die of natural causes and The carbon escapes into the atmosphere where it is later by younger plants and Either way, whether the trees are deliberately burned or they slowly rot, these are both examples of carbon continuing through the In our kelp example, the carbon will be absorbed from the ocean by kelp on the ocean farms – the kelp can be turned into When the fuel is burned, the carbon is released into the atmosphere, then into the ocean and by the kelp on the The carbon stays in the carbon Thus the kelp fuel is considered Fossil Carbon: Fossil carbon comes from deep resources and includes oil and coal taken out of geologic When oil or coal is burned, it is not , because the carbon is newly introduced to the current geologic When fossil carbon is burned, it increases the balance of carbon in the atmosphere and overwhelms the ability of the modern environment to absorb Our oceans have been absorbing far more fossil carbon in recent years, which has been making the oceans warmer and more In addition to warmer oceans, we observe evidence that coral and shells have been damaged, and some have been severely Until we stop burning fossil fuels, the problem will get Sequester Carbon: One way to reduce the fossil carbon in the environment is to sequester the Marine BioEnergy has been asked, do our kelp farms sequester carbon? As mentioned above, for our regular production farms, the answer is The kelp fuel is put in the carbon cycle and the fuel is carbon neutral, but the carbon is not However, if we arrange to sink kelp over a subduction zone, then the kelp would be carried deep between the tectonic plates and would be put away for geologic In that case, we say the carbon is (People talk about planting trees that will live + That is an accepted example of sequestering carbon for a long ) Revolutionizing kelp farming to produce fuel, feed and QUICK LINKS Home Proof of Concept Kelp To Fuel Press Background FAQs References Contact © Marine BioEnergy,   Press | Marine BioEnergy, Skip to content Home Proof of Concept Kelp To Fuel Press Background FAQs References Contact press Marine BioEnergy, In The News Link to the project – Link to the project – ""Could Our Energy Come from Giant Seaweed Farms in the Ocean?"" – SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN By Annie Sneed, March ""Marine cultivation technology opening the door to the rich sources of clean energy in our oceans"" – BBC Science Focus Magazine By Holly Jean Buck, October ""Kelp Farms and Mammoth Windmills Are Just Two of the Government’s Energy Bets"" – New York Times By Brad Plumer, March ""Environmental ingenuity: These creative business ideas aim to be both sustainable and successful"" – By Michelle Boston, USC, July “An experiment off the coast of California may bolster efforts to make biocrude from ‘the Sequoia of the ’” – Inside Science, American Institute of Physics By Katharine Gammon, October ""Kelp Forest Ecosystem: Farming Fuel"" – Wild kingdom With host Stephanie Arne, September ""Could These Robotic Kelp Farms Give Us An Abundant Source Of Fuel?"" – Fast Company By Adele Pete",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210303122350/https://www.marinebiomass.com/', 'timestamp': '20210303122350'}",20210303122350.0,1.0

Below we’ll explore the components of geographically targeted landing pages and why Geo Landing Pages is the best tool to help bring qualified customers and clients to your What are geo landing pages and how do they help with local marketing? To put it simply, a geo landing page is essentially built for companies or websites that work or serve clients or customers in multiple Similarly, it could be of greater use for shops with multiple franchises, each present in a different The purpose of a unique landing page is to help customers in finding a store present within their For instance, think about a local coffee It might be located in just one state, but it might also have franchises in other cities or countries across the So, to make sure that it shows up in the search results for one particular area, the coffee shop should create a landing page for each individual The resulting page is thus what is called a page, and the aim is to attract people living within that particular Why geo landing pages should be a part of your local marketing campaign In , google updated its algorithm with a new feature referred to as Possum . This feature makes several changes to how local searches One of the key features of this update is that search results for locations that are close to the actual searched for are being displayed in higher So, city or town based search results are not limited to the city only, but also include businesses and services in nearby localities ranked highly in the search Furthermore, searchers who are conducting a local search are more likely to be interested in the proximity of a business more than the brand name, professionalism, expertise, While these other factors are also important, the physical proximity takes Therefore, Google filters out the results based on how close a business is to the searcher’s physical As a result, your business is likelier to get higher rankings if it’s close to the customer, and the customer is also more likely to become a potential lead and then a Therefore, it is important to create landing pages, so your customer gets specified content and entry to your What features make up a geo landing page? An important reason why GEO SEO and landing pages have become so popular recently is that studies and Google’s own research shows that over % of the searches conducted on Google are done for local This means that users search for local results and are likelier to click on the results that are specific or at least closer to their To make sure that people come across your page, geo landing pages should include the following: Title tags & Meta Descriptions Just like with regular SEO, title tags and meta descriptions for pages should contain the name of the service or Along with that, they should mention the location of the For example, if you want to make a geo landing page for a “leg pain doctor,” then you should also add in the area you are Resultantly, the final title tag would become “leg pain doctor South El ” This is one of the best practices and promises to deliver excellent Header 1 or H1 In most cases, SEO practices dictate that H1 or the first header should be similar to the title Continuing the example stated above, the H1 tag would be “Leg Pain Doctor South El ” Header 2 or H2 The usual practice is to include more keywords in the second This is where most SEO professionals They fail to fully utilize their However, to make sure that your geo landing page generates more leads, make sure to mention what you are offering in the H2 So in our case, the H2 could be “searching for a leg pain doctor near South El Monte?” Relevant content pertaining to the location This is where geo landing pages differ from regular SEO The latter only includes the most generalized content, which not only seems bland but also can get flagged by google as duplicate It is essential to include content that reflects and informs people about the location and services you are For example, if we consider our leg pain doctor example, it would be great to mention nearby hospitals and leg pain You could go one step further and also include additional facts about your services and how you compare to others in the Offering your viewers unique content will ultimately lead to higher rankings however, it will depend on the kind of quality you provide in your geo landing Relevant im",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210122165806/https://www.toolsy.com/', 'timestamp': '20210122165806'}",20210122165806.0,1.0
