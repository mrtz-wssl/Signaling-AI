From a healthcare perspective, our technology allows for localized therapeutic activation with adjustable intensity. MagGenix-enabled CAR-T cells may replicate and function exclusively at tumor sites, while engineered regulatory T cells can secrete anti-inflammatory antibodies only at inflamed locations (e.g., arthritic joints). In doing so, we allow for localized immunostimulation/immunosuppression without disrupting the entirety of the body’s immune system, all through non-invasive electromagnetic stimulation. Within bioproduction, our system allows for cellular activation and modulation in batch or chemostatic bioreactors. It grants the ability to modulate, change, and halt synthesis in large-scale bioreactors with ultra-cost-efficient magnetic stimulation.

Kelp does not naturally grow in the deep ocean because there are no nutrients in the top layer and kelp needs a substrate for attachment. Marine BioEnergy is building unmanned drone submarines to tow long lines of kelp.  The drones will submerge the farms below the thermocline at night where nutrients are abundant and surface the farms during the day to absorb sunlight. The drones will also submerge the farms to avoid ships and storms. In preliminary testing conducted by a team at the University of Southern California Wrigley Institute, the depth-cycled kelp is growing as well or better than the control kelp. If the kelp continues to thrive in the open ocean environment, the next step is to deploy farms to grow kelp as a biomass feedstock. The proof-of-concept experiments are funded by an award from the U.S. Dept of Energy, Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).

Family Offices, in ever increasing numbers, leverage their entrepreneurial DNA in the pursuit of direct investments. Offices struggle to review proposed investments due to a lack of trust, experience, staff, and/or time. The challenges, associated with the rise in direct investments, encourage a desire for co- investment with like-minded entities. A misalignment in values and horizons, alongside an environment of high fees, drives family offices from traditional investments in public equities and fund structures. High standards with regards to privacy, discretion, and security further limit potential strategic partners. We believe that the best long-term partner for family offices are other family offices. Uniquely capable of leveraging their significant shared expertise, capital, and influence, inter-family office partnerships provide an attractive alternative to traditional fund managers by operating with greater control and flexibility without facing limiting time horizons, high fees, and regulatory restrictions. The opportunity for cross-collaboration often presents itself beyond the traditional realm of capital allocation.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,3,2021,54723,False,False
