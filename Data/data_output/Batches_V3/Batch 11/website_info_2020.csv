footprint is in an area where upstream development has been constrained by the extreme concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in the gas The high volumes of H 2 S have forced producers to divert rigs to other areas, flare sour gas, or wells—eliminating an important resource development opportunity and revenue To solve this problem for producers, Piñon Midstream has designed the most ,

shown that these formations provide optimal sequestration for both CO 2 and H 2 By capturing carbon and permanently sequestering it, Piñon’s CCS program can make meaningful contributions to its
