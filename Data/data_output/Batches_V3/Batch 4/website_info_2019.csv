Answer: The healthcare system was caught ill prepared for a worldwide The health system, which has been moving slowly but surely towards care and other alternative payment models for the last decade, had to realign priorities to from primary care to acute care If has taught us one thing, it is that the payment model has not been resilient or flexible addressing the primary care needs and preventive health challenges created by the The need to transition to care is more urgent than The pandemic caused a delay in elective procedures and has create a significant level of unmet needs going into For most payers this has illuminated the need to accelerate the adoption of more care to help managed care deferred because of the Community health centers, as with other primary care providers in Arizona, found themselves ill prepared for the clinical and social determinants of health impact of the Health centers found themselves unable to maintain service levels as communities were under stay at home ordered, and staff themselves succumb to the The normally high performing health centers had significantly reduced service Women and children’s well care and preventive care services were the first casualties of the health center’s reduced Additionally, health centers’ historic outreach and health education activities in the community were severely curtailed, leaving many communities without a trusted source of health education information about the virus and preventative measures critical to avoiding also impacted health center FFS revenues, which has reduced the health center’s available funding for investment in necessary infrastructure and staff development and The overhang of the pandemic continues into as vaccines where slow to roll out in some Arizona communities and the difficulty health centers have faced overcoming misconceptions and misinformation about and the vaccine that has spread in vulnerable Health centers have also had to use existing staff resources for providing vaccinations that would normally been available to address women and children well care and preventive Question: What barriers do health centers face to be successful in Care? Answer: Community Health Centers have been involved with care for the last five recent months, however, the most of the focus of health centers has been to improve quality performance and have to the most part neglected the management of cost and service Even community health center quality performance has shown mixed results which has reduced payment and tempered some health center interest in participating in payment The role of VBCare Network is to make meaningful systematic changes in the FQHC performance capabilities, especially in the area of their capability managing quality and cost Some community health centers have failed to produce meaningful savings or improved outcomes or have taken too long to make the changes necessary for success in Others have not addressed their organization culture or data infrastructure necessary to compete as an individual health center is Individual FQHC may have a challenge achieving a large enough base of attributed health members achieve adequate This is why VBCare Network was created to support community health centers with these and other Broad adoption of payment arrangement has been slowed among community health centers due to the following challenges: Serving an aging and more vulnerable population who often have significant chronic illnesses and behavioral health The continuing impact of the pandemic on service utilization and its overhang effect into The need for more timely quality and cost data to better manage Delivery system consolidation that has changed the competitive equilibrium of healthcare network contracting and service Continuing challenges of the integration and optimization of electronic healthcare records and clinical decision support Data Exchange and Data Management Challenges Processing data files and the transformation and ongoing enhancement of data to harvest performance insight and use information effectively in performance improvement VBCare Network value to our member health centers is that we provide the data platform and data analytics to make their performance reports timely and Organizational Cultural and Clinical Care Management Change Challenges Beyond information technology, the care delivery requires a culture of continuous performance improvement and formal change management processes in that are foreign to clinical staff who have practiced under an FFS payment model, which is based on service transaction volume and not on the ul",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20211105173911/https://vbcarenetwork.com/', 'timestamp': '20211105173911'}",20211105173911.0,1.0
