Here s why you should try red light Table of Contents Did you know that acne ( acne vulgaris ) is estimated to affect around % of the entire world? That’s over seven hundred MILLION people! What makes this statistic crazier is that the percentage has probably only grown since it was first reported in the Global Burden of Disease Study [ 1 ]. However, acne’s prevalence doesn’t make it an easy problem to have, regardless of age or For many, it’s not only a source of embarrassment but also pain, especially for those who suffer from cystic Speaking from personal experience, I know how devastating acne can be on your I’d struggled with acne for most of my teenage years and even in my early adult It got so bad that I wouldn’t leave the house until I made sure to cover everything up with It didn’t help that all my friends seemed to have clean, flawless While I’d tried both and prescription acne medications, I, like many others, saw little to no It wasn’t until a friend of mine introduced me to a safer, natural, and less expensive acne treatment that I finally got my breakouts under If you haven’t guessed by now, that treatment was red light therapy (RLT). Since then, RLT has been an essential part of my skincare Before I explain how exactly RLT can help fight acne, let’s first discuss why acne If you already know this, feel free to skip on ahead to the next section What Causes Acne ? Acne is caused by dead skin cells and sebum (oil) that clog your hair follicles, leading to excess bacteria growth and In most people, a trigger like hormonal changes (think puberty or pregnancy! ) causes their sebaceous glands to overproduce Generally, sebum is considered a good thing because it protects your skin and hair, keeping them moisturized and Sebum also serves as a food source for Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes ). This bacteria is thought to be responsible for preventing harmful bacteria from entering your pores [ 2 ]. “This acnes strain may protect the skin, much like yogurt’s live bacteria help defend the gut from harmful ” – Huiying Li, PhD However, excess sebum production leads to increased growth of acnes , which triggers an immune Your body sends white blood cells to neutralize this perceived threat, leading to inflammation and As a result, acnes is commonly referred to as bacteria, even though that’s only half the Does Red Light Therapy Help With Acne ? Yes, red light therapy can help with Unlike blue light, red light does not kill acnes But, it does penetrate deeper into the skin, targeting your sebaceous glands and reducing inflammation [ 3 ]. It can help reduce acne breakouts by soothing skin redness, normalizing sebum production, and reducing sebaceous gland In one study, researchers looked at RLT’s effects on both and inflammatory They saw, on average, a %+ They concluded that “red light phototherapy alone can be a new therapeutic option for acne vulgaris ” [ 4 ]. Best of all? There were no observed side No dry, flaky, or peeling No nausea, dizziness, or Plus, you can use RLT to treat your current acne and prevent future acne That’s what makes RLT such an excellent acne Inflammatory acne occurs when blemishes or lesions become red, swollen, and warm to the This type of acne is more severe than acne and includes papules, pustules, nodules, and acne is more common and includes whiteheads (aka closed comedones) and blackheads (aka open comedones). What About Acne Scars ? Acne scarring occurs as a result of improper When acne becomes too clogged with excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria, it swells and ruptures, damaging your If this happens near your skin’s surface, it’ll usually heal quickly and leave little to no evidence But, if the acne penetrates deeper into your skin and ruptures, all the nasty stuff inside can spill out and damage more of your healthy skin Your skin enters “emergency-response mode” and builds new collagen fibers to repair the damage, but it can often produce too little or too This leads to Too little collagen leads to depressed acne scars (aka atrophic scars). Too much collagen leads to raised acne scars (aka hypertrophic scars). Because RLT has been shown to promote healing and normalize collagen production, it can help you prevent those pesky scars from ever What About Hyperpigmentation Acne ?

Each offers incrementally better breast cancer detection in dense breasts than mammography However, Eve Clear Scan™, using molecular breast imaging (MBI) technology, is superior to all of these An MBI examination employs an intravenous (IV) injection of a tracer, Image acquisition can begin nearly immediately after injection while the breast is gently immobilized (not painful: about 1 3 of the force used in mammography). Cancer cells avidly take up the tracer molecules and the emitted gamma rays are detected by a specialized gamma 6 SmartBreast offers two types of gamma camera systems for image acquisition: Eve Clear Scan™ model e680 has a single head array detector using the scintillator crystal sodium iodide (NaI). Eve Clear Scan™ model e750 has a dual head with direct conversion detectors using cadmium zinc telluride (CZT). The strikingly distinctive images produced by MBI provide clear visibility of the cancer in contrast to the generally unhelpful mammographic images in dense Example Case: woman with family history of breast cancer (mother) Mammography Eve Clear Scan™ Eve Clear Scan™ (COLORED) Right (CC) mammographic projection (far left) shows a heterogeneously dense breast that was interpreted as Right CC MBI image (middle) shows intense tracer uptake in cancer mass (arrow).

All three (3) modalities have shown similar sensitivity to visualize the known cancers, but CESM and MBI have higher specifity (ability to predict malignancy) for additional cancers detected compared with 8 Furthermore, MBI is a better imaging method over MRI in the following situations: If you have any metal within your body, such as from a cochlear implant, clip in the brain, or cardiac implantable electronic devices (e.g., pacemaker, cardioverter defibrillator) If you have claustrophobia If you are overweight and find it difficult to lay on your stomach for up to an hour If you have severe allergies to medications or contrast agents If you have poor kidney function References 1 Shapiro S, Strax P, Venet “Periodic breast cancer screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer”.
