https://saferxpharmaceuticals.com,8545,crunchbase,"Home - SafeRx Pharmaceuticals Mission OPIOIDS PATH TO FDA APPROVAL Investors Media Press Blogs Thought Leadership Leadership You can now invest in SafeRX through our Regulation CF Our offering is open to all investors—everybody and our entire community, not just Our investment minimum is just $500. Please see our offering page for details and the link to invest Welcome to SafeRx⁠— an answer to the American opioid We’re on a mission to create safer, healthier communities with far fewer MISSION SafeRx was founded with one mission in mind: to reduce the risk of prescription opioid The opioid crisis represents one of the greatest national public health emergencies of our time, ravaging communities throughout this country for And unlike COVID, there is no vaccine on the way there will never be a “silver bullet” for this intricate But SafeRx has developed a solution to a previously unaddressed dimension of the crisis that is responsible for thousands of fatal prescription overdoses every year…the combination of opioids with The opioid crisis is fueled by According to data from the CDC, % of fatal prescription opioid overdoses are related to concurrent alcohol consumption 1 . And research has shown that long term opioid patients with a history of alcohol problems are five times more likely to overdose on their medication 2 . Because when alcohol is consumed with an opioid, these substances interact in the body to produce much more intense suppression of the nervous system…so intense the brain can actually forget how to Yet despite these risks and unequivocal recommendations from health authorities for opioid users to avoid all alcohol consumption, research has shown that more than one third of patients on long term opioid therapy admit to drinking with their medication 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . As these data show, prescribing physicians currently have no effective means of preventing their patients from making this dangerous, all too often deadly But thanks to SafeRx Pharmaceuticals’ patented new platform of opioids (AROs), they soon OPIOIDS (AROs): HOW THEY WORK Along with the prescription opioid analgesic, ARO products include an enzyme blocker known as an ALDI that interferes with the metabolism of alcohol but otherwise remains essentially inactive in the An opioid , which acts as an analgesic (painkiller). These are identical to opioid compounds that are currently prescribed to An ALDI— Disulfiram (the active ingredient in Antabuse™), which acts as an alcohol A formulation , meaning the opioid and ALDI must be taken together and cannot be If taken as directed, the opioid will act as an analgesic, and the alcohol deterrent will produce no However, if the patient consumes alcohol with the medication, the ALDI produces a powerful, noxious reaction characterized by severe flushing, headaches, nausea, and vomiting (known as the reaction), thereby deterring additional alcohol PATH TO FDA APPROVAL Because all of the active pharmaceutical ingredients included in our ARO platform of products have already been for their intended uses, SafeRx can leverage an expedited FDA application pathway known as a (b)(2). This eliminates the need to duplicate the costly, consuming clinical trials that have already been performed on the original parent drugs, dramatically reducing the scope of new data needed to apply for approval of these ARO combination Through this path, we expect to file new drug applications for our first two ARO products, OxARO™ IR and MethARO™ IR , in less than two And because these products address a national public health emergency, they should qualify for Priority Review, cutting FDA review time to less than six This means our ARO products could start saving lives in less than 2 ½ COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES First Mover with Intellectual Property new class of opioids that are expected to save thousands of Issued USPTO utility patents (#10,478,408 and #10,881,625) enforceable through Disruptive Solution to a National Public Health Emergency Previously unaddressed dimension of the opioid crisis with no effective Reduces liability for opioid New drug applications via (b)(2) pathway expected in less than 2 Drugs will qualify for Priority Review with FDA (review time < 6 months). Abbreviated regulatory pathway clinical trials limited in size scope. No costly technology required “virtual pharmaceutical company” Quality Team Sophisticated, founding team and Extensive industry experience and track record of INVESTORS We anticipate a total need of only $15 million to achieve FDA approval of our two inaugural ARO products (OxARO™ IR and MethARO™ IR). We are dividing this capital raise into two Our current series A round aims to raise $5 million through a Regulation CF offering (for terms, click here ). As we move closer to approval, we plan to raise another $10 million in Series B financing, with updated terms reflecting a progressive anticipated increase in corporate valuation as key development program milestones are Following F",startup,,nan,0.0
