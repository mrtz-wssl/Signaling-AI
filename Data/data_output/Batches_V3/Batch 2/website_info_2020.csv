NDDs, including AD and PD, are the leading cause of life years, or lost years of healthy life, accounting for million DALYs, or % of all DALYs, worldwide in They are also the cause group of death, with million, or % of global deaths in the same year [1] . The World Health Organization estimates that by ( Gammon, ), NDDs will become the second leading cause of death worldwide, taking over cancer and ranking just after cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Global population growth and increased life expectancy mean that brain disorders pose an threat in developed countries, placing an unprecedented and growing strain on public healthcare The current therapeutic options for the treatment of AD and PD are limited to simply mitigating neurodegeneration and relieving symptoms rather than reversing damage With the advent of data generation, integration of data from multiple ‘omics and applying artificial intelligence, we now see evidence to treat AD and PD not as discrete diseases, but as individual, heterogeneous forms of Kidney Diseases Kidney disease, or renal disease, also known as nephropathy, is damage to or disease of a Nephritis is an inflammatory kidney disease and has several types according to the location of the Inflammation can be diagnosed by blood Nephrosis is a kidney Nephritis and nephrosis can give rise to nephritic syndrome and nephrotic syndrome Kidney disease usually causes a loss of kidney function to some degree and can result in kidney failure, the complete loss of kidney Kidney failure is known as the of kidney disease, where dialysis or a kidney transplant is the only treatment Chronic kidney disease is defined as prolonged kidney abnormalities (functional and or structural in nature) that last for more than three Acute kidney disease is now termed acute kidney injury and is marked by the sudden reduction in kidney function over seven About one in eight Americans (as of ) have chronic kidney disease, a rate that is increasing over Revealing the Interactions There are functional links between the gut microbiota and its host that may lead to increase in the harvested energy and alterations in the host We employ modelling of different cell tissue types in the human body and integrate these models with models for the gut The efforts for modelling of the human metabolism started with the reconstruction of generic human which are models representing the comprehensive collections of biochemical reactions that occur in the human These generic models are useful resources for computational modelling as well as network dependent However, metabolism varies in each tissue of the human body and it is therefore necessary to reconstruct cell or tissue specific In this context, several algorithms (reviewed in Mardinoglu, Nat Rev ) have been developed to generate cell tissue specific draft GEMs based on generic human models and data, , proteomics data from the Human Protein It is feasible to understand more about whole body physiology by studying the interactions between the functional cell tissue specific models and microbiome together with integration of clinical data (Mardinoglu and Nielsen, ). This knowledge can be used to elucidate the progression of metabolic disease, make hypotheses for new therapies and design new clinical To this end, the intercellular interactions between the metabolically active human cell types including liver, adipose, muscle, heart and kidney may be studied and these models can be used for integration of data to find metabolic variations and reaction activities in chronic kidney diseases and kidney Furthermore, the modelling of the interactions between different organs may provide an increased understanding about the stages of metabolic The human microbiome composition can regulate the immune systems, affect the host physiology and disease Several factors impact the microbiome such as drugs and Understanding the effect of the drug on the interactions can be a key feature for future Therefore for an efficient treatment strateg",startup,,nan,0.0
