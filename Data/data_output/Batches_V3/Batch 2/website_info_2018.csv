Nevertheless, Uvero Alto beach is home to many destination weddings and luxury resorts for families and Our family spent a week at Dreams Punta We had a great time despite a rocky start and what we feel is too high of a price (Our stay was more than $6,000 including Dreams Punta Cana isn t worth it for everyone .) We hope our experience will help you decide if a stay at Dreams is worth it for your Happy reading and safe travels, wherever you decide to go! Pros Pool - Dreams has the best pool we ve It s gigantic and snakes like a river down the center of the There are perfect spots for swimming, relaxing, watersports and family activities, plus, a bar and plenty of shady spots to hide away Activities - The activity leaders at the resort are personable and “pushy” in the right kind of way: They motivate people to attend the daily events and have fun with each Buffet - Dreams World Cafe has great service and a remarkable spread of international The baked goods and deserts are among the best we ve had (they re baked daily at 3 ). Childcare - Our daughter had a blast at the ""Explorer s Club,"" and begged to stay there each day from 9:30 to 9:30 She also enjoyed the resort’s food, drink and Facilities - The buildings at Dreams are capped at three stories and decorated with Taínos inspired There are coral fossils in the sidewalks and flamingos roaming the It s a spacious place that s romantic at Dreams Punta Cana has tasteful landscaping and lots of space, creating a relaxed Cons Water - With the exception of bars and restaurants, the water at Dreams (and most of Punta Cana) is not safe to Brushing our teeth with bottled water felt Spotty Service - Some of the staffers on the resort were unhelpful, unfriendly, or The end result was a trip with and Being able to communicate with the staff in Spanish was a Airport Transfers Not Included - Dreams is not a cheap resort and we were disappointed that we had to arrange our own transportation to and from Punta Cana International Airport (which cost around $200 extra). Aggressive Vendors - The resort allows vendors on its They sell cigars, artwork and We found them annoying, aggressive and unwilling to take ""no"" for an Advertisement: Our Verdict and Rating 4 out of 5 - Dreams Punta Cana gets many things wrong, but what it does well more than compensates for those This is a fun resort that we d be happy to visit Non-Spanish speakers should subtract half a point from this Additionally, we would have rated the resort a full point lower had we not booked a ""Preferred Club"" room (that unlocked certain benefits around the resort).

A preferred room unlocks various privileges and amenities throughout the There are major advantages to booking a preferred room: Preferred guests are allowed to access the Preferred Club Lounge, which houses the best bar on the resort and a wonderful buffet of gourmet snacks (from 7 to ) The best seating on Uvero Alto beach (including cabanas with mattress beds) is reserved for preferred club members and Preferred guests can request a goose feather pillow to replace the foam pillow that all rooms have by default (the down pi",startup,,nan,0.0
