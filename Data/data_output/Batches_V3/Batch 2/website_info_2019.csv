I m currently at the logo concept development phase for a project I m currently working on, so I m actually still exploring a lot of This is one direction that I will most probably include in the concept Will still narrow it down to one concept I was wondering what you guys think fit the brand the most, and if you guys have seen anything CONTEXT: Name: Amorene Jewelry Products: & Gold Feedback that should be approved looks like: What Works Well: ​ Love where you’re going with this concept - the the “A” and eternity theme is a good call in all your designs, I definitely see the inclusive I would recommend working with the third graphic option you posted because the flat bottom will be easy to center the store name beneath, and the layered outlines are more well balanced than the second & fourth ​ What Could Be Better: ​ One idea is to consider varying the line thickness to give the logo a more calligraphic feel, which I think would also help you hit on the luxurious Also, at a glance, the logo could feel more reminiscent of an “&” symbol than an “A”, maybe consider moving the pointed bottom center portion of the logo up just a tad to communicate more of a horizontal cross point like an “A” Hope that helps! Feedback that should be reported looks like: What Works Well: ​ They all look really good - I don t think you can go wrong with any of them!

We are all plagued by false positives in our own work, or the belief that it is as good as it can If it could be better, we would simply make it While we may be able to perfect our work based on our experiences and perspective, our approach and interpretation of the work is limited to The more you work on a project, the greater your curse of knowledge you lose the ability to have a first impression of your Why not friends and family? A plethora of research presented in “The Mom Test”, which is used as Harvard curriculum, demonstrates that friends and family are more likely to lie to your face than provide actionable Friends and family have the best of intentions they believe in you and want to build you up, but just because you’re great doesn’t mean the first draft of your work Plus, no one wants to be the bearer of bad news (we believe feedback is good news, which we discuss here, but critique has a stigma of reflecting poorly on the creator). Telling someone their work is flawless preserves the personal relationship, and is an easier response than carefully analyzing work to recommend Plus, unless your friends and family are fellow creatives in your field, how actionable can their advice be beyond an initial visceral reaction to what you have created?
