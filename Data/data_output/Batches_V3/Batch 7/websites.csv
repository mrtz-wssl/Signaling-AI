Consumers want to immerse themselves in memorable moments, but often crave alternatives to alcohol. Cannabis products have become more popular and a wide variety of new pioneering cannabis-based options continue to change the landscape of nightlife and social gatherings. LOKI blends these consumer trends and offers a completely new way to enjoy the night. A true innovation in drinking. With only a few sips, you can enhance any moment. As knowledge, research, and complexity around the marijuana industry evolves, new discoveries about the active ingredients and their unique characteristics are constantly being discovered. LOKI's unique ingredient is Delta-8-THC, which is one of the lesser-known natural elements of the cannabis plant. It differs from its more commonly known relative Delta-9-THC by a slight variation in molecular structure. Most cannabis users experience the potent effects of Delta-9, as it makes up the majority of the plant's THC presence. However, by using an extraction method, LOKI can take the more isolated and rarer Delta-8 and offer a cleaner overall experience. Delta-8 offers consumers a far lower psychotropic potency, while still giving them the ability to immerse in prolonged and enjoyable moments.

You can help your children build good habits and discipline by making quests recurring. You can assign and easily track allowances to quests too, turning your standard chore chart into a fun, engaging game that is great for the whole family.

The App also allows patients to browse providers based on specialties and services offered, as well as by insurances accepted. This way, patients avoid surprises when arriving at the front desk. Additional patient benefits include: -- Filling out paperwork before arriving at urgent care facilities, hospitals, and other walk-in medical providers -- Seeing medical care facility information, including locations, hours of operation, estimated wait times, contact information, specialties and services offered, and insurances accepted -- Storage of their medical forms, medical history, pre-existing conditions, etc. -- Reduction of wait times in hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms, and other medical care providers -- Reduction of stress associated with unplanned, last-minute care and medical emergencies Urgently Health also notifies the hospital or clinic a patient chooses that they are on their way to them, providing healthcare facilities with an approximate travel time. This feature allows providers to expect patients and better prepare for their arrival before they get there. This is vitally important during emergencies where mere minutes can make a difference! Our accompanying Web Platform allows hospitals and clinics who accept walk-in patients to process them more effectively and with less confusion than in the past. When healthcare facilities use our Platform, they expand their visibility and streamline their day-to-day operations. This, in turn, increases their preparedness and allows them to discover and overcome bottlenecks, leading to more effective and efficient service, greater patient satisfaction and retention, and decreased costs. With patient information on-hand before they arrive, providers can assign severity, pre-triage, and verify information before their patients arrive.

There is often no time to digest what has happened and grieve for the loss of the old normal. Beyond that, a patient and their support group now must become expert project managers and level-up on their medical knowledge. If you’ve been in this situation or supported someone who is, you know it’s completely overwhelming.  Friends and family are concerned, and feel bad about the interruptions it causes when they reach out to ask for help.  Some friends and family simply stop reaching out, not knowing what to say or do. All of them care, and know that their loved one can’t have 75 conversations a day while during normal times, much less with the additional burden of recovery.  That’s why we created ReplyAll Health. We have experienced major health issues like cancer and COVID. We were desperate to keep our community updated and wanted to be sure they could stay informed without creating an extra burden.
