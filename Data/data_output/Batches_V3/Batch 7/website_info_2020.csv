Categorically YES! Not only are you working on a great platform that gives you extremely granular control over every aspect of your online store - SEO included - you get the benefits of an CDN (content delivery network) powered by Fastly . You don’t need to be a tech expert and get into the details, what matters is this means that your store will load reliably, and quickly anywhere on the Site performance is a major technical SEO factor , so the fact that Shopify eliminates the time and cost overhead of site optimization and management means you get to spend your time focusing on running and growing your The short version is that not only is Shopify good for SEO, it makes it easy to So, what can you do without having to hire a pro to maximize your Shopify store’s SEO? I’ll split this into two categories: things specific to Shopify, and things relevant to web SEO in General SEO This is the stuff you need to be doing at the bare minimum for all your web It’s not hard, just tedious, so the sooner and more often you get it taken care of and set up, the easier your life will be! I’ll only touch on the major points of these, but for a really look at SEO go read my How To SEO Audit series of Keyword Research The first thing you absolutely must do is nail down your keyword You might think you know exactly what keywords to target, but this will let you figure out that out for sure and give you a better understanding of both your market and how they’re looking and searching for what you Keyword research is probably going to be the most time consuming portion of your Shopify SEO journey, but trust me - it will pay off dividends And remember - it’s automatically giving you a leg up on your competitors who don’t take the time to do this step right, or at all! First things first - most ‘first pass’ keywords are broad and don’t have Let’s take a step back and figure out: Who is it that you’re targeting? What problem do they have that you solve? Why are they trying to solve that issue? When searching for solutions to this issue, how do they do so? What questions are they asking? What specific words are they using? Why does that issue exist in the first place? How do you solve that issue for them? Going through the exercise of these questions puts you in a much better place to “get” your buyer’s behavior, intent, and search habits, letting you better form your keyword Not only that, it has the secondary benefits of informing both your content strategy and your lead capture system and sales funnels! From this point you can jump into determining search volumes, related keywords, expanding into keywords, recording the competition landscape - but above all else, ensure that while you’re going through that exercise you keep in mind your buyer’s intent, and how you are solving a problem for Review and Grow Your Content Marketing Content is king in the eyes of Google, and it’s your number one tool in winning the SEO game when you don’t yet have an established backlink This is your time to shine with content that directly addresses those buyer problems we were talking about Giving them content where they can be the hero of the story using your products to achieve success is one of the most tried and true and Also, realize that you often need to build up a relationship with prospective Consumers aren’t impulse purchasing as much as they used to, and for better or worse there’s a significantly longer sales cycle for consumer goods than we’ve seen in the past as reviews and ratings are only a few searches So leverage your content to start establishing a relationship where you provide value before any money has even exchanged No one likes the pushy salesman, don’t let your content be that guy! And then remember: great content gets shared - and really great content that gets shared gets This is ultimately what we want to aim for make sure your blog and other content pieces are genuinely useful to your audience and not just a sales Technical Shopify SEO This is thankfully mostly hands off here because of Shopify’s Even so, there are a few and sanity checks you should First up is to review your site’s link If you have any old products that moved or were discontinued, you will",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20210127035119/https://connorwhitman.com/', 'timestamp': '20210127035119'}",20210127035119.0,1.0

What we don t like? What are the root causes? What are the bad consequences? How do we want it to be? Who are involved and what are their visions and interests? 2 Setting a goal Where do we want to get? What is an optimal method and why? How do we know we have succeeded? When can we stop? What is the ultimate goal? 3 Designing an impact What process should we build to start Whose life will change and how will they feel it? How will we measure a progress towards? Who is interested in a change and would love to join? What can they bring to a process? How can we facilitate their participation? 4 Funding the changes Who and how will benefit from a shift? How can we measure it? How can we borrow a part of those benefits in future to make a change today? 5 Measuring and managing the process How big is the problem? Does it evolve? What are the critical values and conditions? What changes are irreversible? How rapid do we affect? Do we have enough resources? What and how will we measure to see desired changes? How do we know we have reliable data? 6 Communicating the aspirations and achievements Who is interested in knowing what we do? Why are they and what they wish to know? What is the best way to provide that information? How to get feedback from them? Defining a problem The more we know about the problem, the more accurate, effective and cheap the solution will Every specific problem is always a part of a bigger system and a longer And every problem is always a solution for someone else s another When we plan any change, the first part is to define a current Where we are and what we want to change? The most common mistake here is to start acting without enough understanding of the This often leads to the common failures: infinite fighting with the consequences, strengthening the problem instead of defeating it, creating a new problem or just moving one to a new place, facing an unexpected resistance from other To define a problem properly we should answer the following questions: What is going on, and why do we think it s a problem? Who is experiencing a problem and how? How many of them, and how can we define and describe that group? Do they recognize a problem (or who else recognized it) and how? How did they try to solve it?
