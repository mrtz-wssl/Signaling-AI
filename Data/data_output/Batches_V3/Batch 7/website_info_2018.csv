https://infinitepower.me/,16644,crunchbase,"Fundamentos – Infinitepower English Español Inicio Fundamentos Funcionalidades Contacto Menú Descubre tu infinito Poder Tu realidad es creada por tus creencias y Si mejoras tus pensamientos mejoras tu estado mental y emocional, con lo cual: Responderás mejor a cualquier situación Pasarás a disfrutar más de todo lo que te rodea Atraerás a tu vida todo aquello que deseas Y como consecuencia podrás crear, cambiar o potenciar definitivamente tu Pero para mejorar tus pensamientos, necesitas primero reprogramar tu Aquí podrás encontrar respuestas a las preguntas que tal vez te estés haciendo sobre el funcionamiento de tu mente y qué hacer para Hemos resumido y simplificado los conceptos para presentártelos de la forma más accesible ¿Cómo funciona la mente? La mente es el cerebro en funcionamiento . Tiene dos partes diferentes trabajando juntas: la mente consciente y la mente subconsciente . Así es como trabajan: El cerebro percibe las señales de lo que ocurre a tu alrededor, y la mente interpreta esto basándose en patrones de pensamientos que han sido reforzados y guardados en el subconsciente con A partir de esta interpretación, activa mecanismos en el cerebro para liberar químicos (como los neuropéptidos) y enviar señales al cuerpo para que libere hormonas que llegan a todas las células del cuerpo a través del torrente Estos químicos son los que hacen que reacciones de una manera u otra, por ejemplo, sintiendo: ansiedad, apetito, sueño, preocupación, estrés, En pocas palabras, la percepción que tu mente tiene para interpretar una situación, controla tu cuerpo y modifica tu salud mental y emocional, incidiendo en tu respuesta y en las consecuencias ¿Por qué deberías preocuparte por tus creencias? Un evento es un factor externo que ya ocurrió y generalmente poco o nada se puede hacer para Normalmente ante un mismo evento las personas reaccionan de forma diferente ya que la interpretación que hace la mente de cada una de esas personas es La interpretación que tu mente hace de un evento incide en tu respuesta y por ende en las consecuencias Pongamos un ejemplo simple: de regreso a casa, un semáforo se pone en rojo justo antes que puedas pasar . • En base a la interpretación de tu mente, una respuesta desfavorable hará que sientas malestar hasta el punto de renegar de tu Relacionarás ese evento con otros eventos del día y sentirás impaciencia y ansiedad por llegar, lo cual incluso puede llevarte a tomar decisiones que pongan en riesgo a otros o a ti • Por otro lado, si la interpretación de tu mente se orienta a una respuesta favorable , sentirás tranquilidad, aprovecharás el momento para descansar, para hacer una pausa de forma segura, permitiéndote observar y disfrutar de tu entorno, incluso recordarás algo que te motive o te haga Esbozaras una sonrisa y Como te darás cuanta el evento es el mismo pero la reacción y las consecuencias son distintas ya que parten de interpretaciones diferentes y es por esto que tus creencias son tan importantes , porque constituyen el patrón contra el cual tu mente realiza la interpretación del ambiente y de los eventos . ¿Cómo se relacionan la mente consistente y subconciente? Tu realidad está compuesta en un 5% por las consecuencias de tus acciones conscientes y en un % por las de tu influencia Un ejemplo ampliamente difundido compara los pensamientos con semillas, la mente consciente con el jardinero que las planta y la mente subconsciente con la tierra del jardín en el cual son La tierra del jardín (mente subconsciente) no discrimina las semillas (pensamientos) buenas de las malas, simplemente hará crecer y enraizar las que el jardinero (mente consciente) decida plantar . Estas semillas (pensamientos) se plantan constantemente durante todo el día mediante la repetición, que es la forma en que el jardinero (mente consciente) entierra las semillas (pensamientos) en la tierra (mente subconsciente) para crear el jardín (tu realidad). La evidencia demuestra de forma contundente que todo lo que siembres en tu mente subconsciente lo cosecharás en lo que eres como persona , en lo que te rodea y en tu realidad . Algunas semillas son buenas (tendrán resultados maravillosos) , pero otras pueden ser malas (tener consecuencias demoledoras y limitantes) para el jardín es decir para tu vida y tu Otro ejemplo conocido es el que compara la mente consciente con un antiguo proyector de cine, y la mente subconsciente con la cinta . Lo que ves en la película de tu vida es lo que tu mente consciente proyecta , y tu mente consciente proyecta lo que está guardado en tu mente subconsciente . Estas dos comparaciones dejan en claro una cosa: es vital que generes desde la consciencia las sugestiones correctas al subconsciente . En palabras de estos ejemplos, reprogramar tu mente subconsciente es el equivalente a sembrar las semillas correctas en la tierra para crear el jardín que quieres como realidad o grabar en la cinta lo que deseas ver reflejado en la película de tu ¿Cómo se puede reprogramar la mente s",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20220309054551/https://infinitepower.me/', 'timestamp': '20220309054551'}",20220309054551.0,0.0
