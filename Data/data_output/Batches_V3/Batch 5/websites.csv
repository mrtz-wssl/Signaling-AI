One day, you may need some notifications and not want others. The next day, your needs may be the exact opposite. Distracting notifications aren't limited to shopping websites or social media. Sometimes, distractions can come from another client or a coworker. Our app allows you to easily adapt and hone in on your needs for that day, without fear of missing anything important.  — Need to mute a specific client's pings across 6 different apps for one day? One-click.  — Need to prioritize everything on one project but mute the others? One or two clicks.  — Want to mute everything except your mom? Cool.
