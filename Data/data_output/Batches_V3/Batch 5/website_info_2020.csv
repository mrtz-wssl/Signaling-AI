You’re probably like most people who are looking for a way to become financially free by investing your hard earned You may have tried the stock market and invested in owning rental homes, but these are either very volatile (stocks) or they require a lot of work (rental homes). Is there another way to invest that offers better returns without the volatility? Does passive investing really exist?

Think about it: first you spend a lot of time researching the cars you want, then you have to find local You need to pinpoint their locations and either drop in one day or make further telephone inquiries to find out if they have what you If they don’t, then you have to wait longer for them to get your dream model from their All of this is before you get to all the paperwork needed to actually purchase the things and drive it off the Automotive aggregators like are built to take the sting out of buying a Their goal is to cut down wasted time by connecting users with various dealership and, more importantly, showing them the items that they actually have in Using this platform, customers can connect directly with a dealer that has the exact car they want, ready to This greatly speeds up the process, and simplifies it, You don’t have to wade through the sales patter as you tell them what you want and they counter with something else they want to sell Pain Point 2: Haggling with the Dealer is Unpleasant Solution: Customers Name Their Price and Wait for the Dealers to Come to Them The days of hustling for bargains are firmly behind The modern consumer does not enjoy the process of bargaining, preferring the “one-click purchase” culture created by online shopping experiences they engage with Younger buyers like to see a price, agree with it and take This is where platforms like once again have a role to CarBevy allows buyers to first name their The vast majority have done their online research in advance, and they know roughly how much the car should cost, and how much they are willing to This is then sent to multiple dealers, who will either take it or leave It’s a neat It’s good for dealers because they are connecting with a willing buyer who is even setting out a It’s also good for buyers because it’s very likely dealers will snap up these offers in order to stay competitive in a tough It’s Pain Point 3: Pricing is Steered by the Dealerships Solution: Put Some of This Power in the Hands of the Buyer It has always been the practice that buyers followed the prices set by The dealers, in turn, were usually following recommended retail rates from either their parent or from the going market rates plus reasonable profit for the The result of all this is a system where new car buyers are shut out of the pricing Online platforms often claim to be offering “the best price,” but is that true? Since they are in a partnership with the dealerships, it follows that their primary directive is to benefit their own company (and shareholders) and the This means prices will be set to achieve those goals, and not to genuinely save the buyer Allowing car buyers some purchase in the pricing arena — as they do get on — means that the market will start to work for the This should solve the pain point of prices being constantly out of our control as Modern Car Buyers are Motivated by the Experience Though many tend to think of Generations Y and Z as cynical who eschew commercialism and refuse to buy cars, they couldn’t be m",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20201202031532/https://www.carbevy.com/', 'timestamp': '20201202031532'}",20201202031532.0,1.0
