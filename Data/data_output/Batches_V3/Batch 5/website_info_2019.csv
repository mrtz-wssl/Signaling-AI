It is better to have a clear set of instructions about how data should be handled or, at least, a very clear idea in mind about what your task is Labelers are very important elements of data annotation process, especially when it comes to specific data labeling tasks, such as ones relating to agriculture, medicine, sports or Diverse expertise and availability of specialists in various fields is among the benefits of outsourced services, which do their best to accommodate their Management of people all together is off your hands when you decide to There is a surprising amount of work that goes into hiring and training employees, connecting and securing the tech, communicating instructions and Related closely to this, are the more flexible possibilities of scaling when Scaling up or down along with your project needs isn t a problem, since labelers can be reassigned to different projects, instead of being completely laid Label Your Data annotators (office #2, Kyiv, Ukraine) One last thing to consider is the When making your own team, you ll need to put additional time into modifying an existing software for data labeling or even develop your own Whilst when hiring a team to do data labeling for you, they can help you in developing or choosing the right tools for the task you Among the few things that may be frustrating for managers looking into outsourcing options are less control over the processes and need for trust third parties to handle your Even if outsourced, a team of labelers remains an extension of your own This mindset should be maintained for a smoother collaboration through continuous communication and clear Quality, speed and price — the golden triangle of data labeling There is a primary set of measures that define a good data annotation It s the quality of their work, how fast they perform their tasks and the funds needed to cover all the Quality In our previous articles, we have discussed the importance of high quality data labeling and best practices to measure data labeling Indeed, datasets themselves matter — they must be balanced and include a variety of data However, the quality of emplo",startup,"{'status': '200', 'available': True, 'url': 'http://web.archive.org/web/20200803175745/https://labelyourdata.com/', 'timestamp': '20200803175745'}",20200803175745.0,1.0
