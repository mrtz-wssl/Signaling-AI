Inhibiting the onset of illness is the ultimate goal of healthcare This is where preventative healthcare, also known as proactive healthcare, comes This approach focuses on encouraging and guiding individuals to take care of their minds and bodies in order to stay healthy, avoid or delay the onset of disease, and intercept diseases in their infancy before more invasive options become the only Why is Preventative Care Important? Many chronic diseases are preventable through lifestyle choices, early detection, and management of risk For example, managing cholesterol levels significantly lowers the risk of heart attack and If cholesterol levels could be reduced by %, the incidence of coronary artery disease could drop by an estimated percent [ ] . So, how does one reduce their cholesterol level? By eating a healthy diet low in saturated fats, exercising, avoiding smoking, losing weight, and limiting alcohol consumption [ ]. In fact, it’s well known that four risk factors, in particular, directly lead to the majority of chronic disease: tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and poor diet [ ]. Notably, all four of these risk factors are This means healthcare professionals can introduce proactive interventions to help individuals modify their behavior to reduce their risk factors, thereby preventing or delaying chronic disease Taking Prevention a Step Further with Predictive Care Predictive care takes things a step further, allowing individuals—in partnership with healthcare professionals—to intervene before conditions have a chance to Predictive care relies on advanced technological developments that collect personal health and lifestyle Recognizing patterns and revealing insights based on this data can help doctors anticipate health issues with unprecedented precision, pinpointing behaviors individuals should avoid and actions individuals can take before risk factors even This approach not only helps clinicians make more informed decisions about an individual’s care, but also empowers the patient to take a proactive role in their The patient goes from passively receiving care to being an active participant in their Who Will Lead the Shift to Preventative and Predictive Healthcare?
