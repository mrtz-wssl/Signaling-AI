MQ can be defined as a sustained system of psychological, cognitive, affective, social and ethical functioning derived from (1) an ability to differentiate from the states of others (2) an ability to engage in reflective and analogic processing to understand and mobilize a dynamic between thinking and feeling in self and others and (3) a commitment to the and development of self and It is a , mature, patterned and consistent way of functioning cognitively, socially, ethically and It is also a sophisticated ability involving attunement, decentering, and introspection and a process of observing intersubjective and phenomena in the process of data collection that informs decision making or interventions in phenomenological moments (Arnold ).
