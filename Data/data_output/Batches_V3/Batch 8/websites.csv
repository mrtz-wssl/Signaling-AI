Anyone can use it freely in the comfort of their own home. It requires no effort and gives great results. Numerous studies have proven the effectiveness of fat freezing with over 19 clinical trials found on Google, including studies which prove that placing a frozen mass against targeted areas of the body for prolonged periods can kill off fat cells. The versatility of the bands means that you can perform fat freezing in the comfort and privacy of your own home. Around 40 years ago scientists observed children that ate a lot of popsicles developed dimples in their cheeks. They discovered that white fat cells are susceptible to cold temperatures, and when exposed to the right amount of cold for the right amount of time the white fat cells would literally freeze and die which caused dimples. This was the beginning of Fat Freezing, known as Cryolipolysis, which has now been scientifically proven with numerous studies. Subcutaneous fat, or white fat cells under the skin, are sensitive to cold. This is the thick fat found on your waist, hips, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, back, flanks and chests. By using your fat freezing band system on a target area or areas every day for a minimum of 3 weeks, combined with a diet and exercise plan, you can reduce the fat in that area up to 20-30%. Arm, legs, hips, stomach, back, waist, behind, man-boobs, muffin tops, love handles, wherever you have that stubborn fat, our system will reduce the fat while in the comfort of your own home.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,5,2019,61377,False,False
