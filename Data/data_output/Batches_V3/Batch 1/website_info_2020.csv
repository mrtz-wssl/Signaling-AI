the proteins produced in an organism, cell, or biological Using high resolution mass spectrometry, data from the proteome can provide insight into proteins and their signaling pathways as the drivers of human physiology and Yatiri Bio explicitly prioritizes this data as the key to understanding how and why particular drugs successfully eradicate Recent advances in this technology allow for the identification and quantification of thousands ( 8,000) of proteins per In addition, the signaling pathways can be accurately monitored via analysis of post translational modifications (PTM) that steer biochemical Consequently, these analyses address the relevant disease on a cellular level including direct observation of the effects of drug The advantage of studying the proteome (versus the current standard of identifying only a selective few biomarkers) is that we are able to identify more robust biomarker signatures, improve patient selection, and drive therapies for personalized

compounds show robust activity in cellular and animal models, % of the compounds that progress to clinical trials fail due to poor correlation between the models and the patients they are meant to The
