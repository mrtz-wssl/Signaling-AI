assessment Identify the assets and define the risk and critical value for each device (based on the client input), such as a security assessment vulnerability It’s important to identify at least the importance of the device that you have on your network or at least the devices that you’ll It’s also important to understand if the device (or devices) can be accessed by any member of your company (such as a public computer or a kiosk) or just administrators and authorized Understand the strategic factors and have a clear understanding of details, including: Risk appetite Risk tolerance level Risk mitigation practices and policies for each device Residual risk treatment Countermeasures for each device or service (if the service is correlated with the device) Business impact analysis Perform a vulnerability scan Third, Use the right policy on your scanner to accomplish the desired Prior to starting the vulnerability scan, look for any compliance requirements based on your company’s posture and business, and know the best time and date to perform the It’s important to recognize the client industry context and determine if the scan can be performed all at once or if a segmentation is An important step is to and get the approval of the policy for the vulnerability scan to be For the best results, use related tools and on the vulnerability assessment platform, such as: Best scan (i.e., popular ports) CMS web scan (Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, general CMS, ) Quick scan Most common ports best scan (i.e., ,535 ports) Firewall scan Stealth scan Aggressive scan Full

useful and are ordered in a way to ensure the understanding of the However, it’s important to keep the following details in mind and realize that high and medium vulnerabilities should have a detailed
