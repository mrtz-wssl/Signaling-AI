Feedback showed the majority of tribe members were thrilled with the initial I continued to offer just 6 Profitable Niche Reports every month for $29.99 for almost 3 However, fast forward to December I decided that profitable niche reports alone are not enough for Because let s be honest a niche being profitable is one thing and you personally profiting from that niche is another thing Here s the To profit from a niche you also need marketing and business education, an online business model, and a clear plan with all the step by step instructions to complete the essential online marketing tasks from scratch to Makes sense, right? So on that basis, in December I completely revamped the members area to become ""NicheHacks Insider"" which delivered all of the necessary education, research, training and step by step plans to follow as well as niche and business From members testimonials, some which you ll see later in this page, the feedback was extremely positive! Seriously, existing members were ecstatic at the new upgraded ""NicheHacks Insiders"" and more new members joined than ever before to take advantage of the improved Though I wasn t ready to stop So in the final months of , even with all the satisfied customers and positive feedback, I decided to take ""NicheHacks Insider"" to the next level In my mind there was one thing The missing ingredient was my unique, and personal, step by step system to go from scratch to success with online So for the first few months of I locked myself away for hours per day and 7 days per During that time I documented and detailed all my step by step processes for systematically and logically building an online business from scratch (including the stupidly simple ""Million Dollar Idea"" process which resulted in NicheHacks being born and the GVTO skill which if mastered will ensure you re never financially struggling again in life).

Everything in the ERA Process focuses on foundational marketing and business strategies, education, research and step by step action to build a real problem solving, value giving, business you can be proud if you ve never built a business before (hey, we all have to start somewhere). It means you can stop dreaming about financial freedom and start taking action towards financial freedom instead, without becoming stuck or lost due to the Education, Research and Action Plans Let me tell you more about the ERA Process which powers The ERA Process Breaks Down Into The Following 3 Stage 1: E is for The Education Transforms you into a ""relative expert"" in your niche as little as days through a simple learning and research process (without the need to ""fake it till you make it"" as I ll prove to you).

Today, economic growth is primarily contingent on increased resource In this linear economic approach, organizations harvest or extract materials, use them to create products, and then sell those products to consumers who generally incinerate or send to landfill the materials that no longer serve their original As the population grows and the negative environmental impact of resource extraction continues, this “take, make, waste” model is quickly reaching its The circular economy, by contrast, is one that is “restorative and regenerative by design, and aims to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, ). Here are some pioneers leading the way to a circular According to a report by McKinsey in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, US$1 trillion a year could be generated by for the global The market momentum is clearly accelerating with major corporations committing toward circular A survey conducted by ING in interviewing executives found that % of American companies now plan to move toward Nearly twice as many companies say that they are embedding sustainability in strategic in compared to How will enable businesses to move towards a Circular Economy? consumer goods currently account for per cent of material inputs into the economy and per cent of municipal waste according to McKinsey paper “Towards the Circular Economy”.

Neural machine translation has changed the But the problems of life as a machine translation researcher have not changed: BLEU obsession, slow human evals and random catastrophic translation Those problems are not Google, Microsoft and everybody else know that BLEU isn t useful when it comes to very good translations or very bad But what is the alternative? Find your fails before your users do ModelFront finds translation Now we re offering to help machine translation teams Leveraging our risk prediction technology, we catch your translation fails, scalably and Fail lists With big lists of fails, you can understand and fix problems in your dataset, pipeline or approach, and also apply patches before there s Fail rates With the rates of fails per million, you can compare systems and versions, and protect against nasty regressions in the long Fail reports We summarize our findings, and report to you possible major or minor bugs in your pipeline or Useful metrics ModelFront lists and rates include a breakdown by error Structure Errors with words dropped or inserted, and errors with agreement Untranslated Errors with words left untranslated, or translated to the wrong language Names Errors with literally translated or mixed up person names, placenames, brand names, product names, and org names Symbols Errors with numbers, prices, dates, codes, URLs, emails, hashtags and usernames Locale Errors around localisation of numbers, prices, dates and quotes Formatting Errors with casing and punctuation Semantics Errors with negation, context, function words, content words, ambiguity, and idioms Robustness Robustness to input that is wrong language, very long, mixed language, wrong script, missing diacritics, bad encoding, character variants, spelling variants, typos, missing spaces, casing, punctuation, and out of distribution Scandals Translations that are NSFW, offensive or violent, or mix up named entities Fast and continuous ModelFront quality evaluations are scalable and You can compare systems, perform grid search, set up continuous integrations or monitoring on fresh incoming How is it different than quality evaluation, like BLEU? BLEU requires a reference translation, and doesn t distinguish between stylistic variations and scandalous translation Today there are systems that have roughly the same BLEU score as human translators, but translation fails still ModelFront requires no reference translation, doesn t get triggered by output that is noisy or machiny but good enough, and also covers the long How is it different than quality estimation (QE)? The main metric in the QE task is Like BLEU, it focuses on edit distance or time, so it does not distinguish stylistic variations from scandalous translation Unlike BLEU, it doesn t require reference translations, but it does require labelled training QE is most useful in that context of CAT platforms for human ModelFront is built specifically to catch really bad How is it different than translation? If only it were that easy! translations often match the original even when the translation was This could be because of identity translations - words or phrases that failed to translate - or literal translations - of an idiom or semantically ambigous word or phrase - or just bad training data that causes corresponding errors in both On the other hand, translations often don t match the original even when the translation was Every language has distinctions that it cannot represent, both structural - for example, between cases, tenses, formality or genders - or semantic - because of homonyms, including named entities, and So a translation is too often a lossy represention of the For the many indirect pairs , there is additional ModelFront uses translations, but it s a small signal among How is it different than confidence? Modern neural models have some clue about their own confidence, but many if not most translation fails are due to bad data or the inherent complexity of human Glassbox techniques can fail precisely when translation On the other hand, confidence may be low just because there are multiple synonymous ModelFront is an independent system, specifically focused on risk Translation engines are blackboxes to How is it different than hardcoding approaches? approaches can be very effective for certain error types, number formats, or in certain scenarios, when there is an extensive translation Notable examples include LexiQA, WMT test suites, or features offered within CAT tools like Smartling and ModelFront predictions come from deep learning models, including unlabelled data, to scale robustly on unseen data, variations, and noise, across language Is it automated, or just crowdsourcing?
