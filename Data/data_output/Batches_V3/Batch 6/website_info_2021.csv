Computing (IMC) IMC is a model of computing where all of the data required for a particular task to be performed is held within This is opposed to a model, commonly seen in today’s compute systems whether at small or hyperscale, where there is insufficient memory to hold all of the data required for a complex task such as machine learning This results in the CPU, GPU or other processor needing to wait while data is fetched from a memory or storage source which is orders of magnitude slower than its local RAM, creating performance and efficiency Today’s Compute Systems In today’s compute systems, it is difficult to outfit an individual server with all of the RAM that it may need due to the technical capabilities of server chipsets including memory access limitations and slot count, as well as economic factors such as uncertainty about where a specific workload may be performed due to the use of abstraction layers common in cloud deployments, which may leave a single server that is with RAM The result is a hard choice between small amounts of fast memory which is IMC capable, and large amounts of slow remote memory in the form of storage technologies which are not fast enough to be suitable for Tomorrow’s Compute Systems Using TORmem technologies, a new tier of system memory can be added which provides a level of performance that is comparable to local system RAM, but with the same disaggregated, but model seen in slower types of memory or storage The result is a compute system, whether one rack or the combination of hundreds, which is no longer limited by the small capacity and inflexibility of local memory or the speed of traditional remote memory or storage The CPU, GPU or any other accelerator can be kept fully fed, allowing new workloads to be supported and for current workloads to operate more Optimizing System Costs By disaggregating large quantities of local system RAM from each server within the rack, the cost of each individual server can be reduced, as can the impact of its failure on the memory capacity of the entire server Much like the disaggregation of server storage that the industry has seen, we believe that the disaggregation of memory through our technology will bring about efficiency and design simplicity savings for systems large and Why Disaggregated Memory?

While our experiences were worlds apart, as institutionalized kids in the , we wondered: Did anyone out there care about us? If anyone knew what was happening behind closed doors, would they intervene? Was help ever coming? We didn’t know it then, but help was coming – some years As adults, haunted by our own traumatic memories of Cedar Ridge Academy (along with other facilities), we became empowered by finding the TTI (troubled teen industry) survivor We took comfort in speaking with (or typing to) people who viscerally understood the sorts of moral injuries and lingering scars we carry from those years: fears of abandonment, trust issues, PTSD, anxiety, depression, low self esteem, and most especially, the recurring nightmares of being back at the program and unable to Being sent away was what I’ve come to understand as a “vital disjuncture:” an event that clearly cut my life in two: a relatively carefree “before” and a deeply painful “after.” Institutionalization had a devastating impact on my It has diminished my potential and delimited my future possibilities, in countless Each year, my body remembers my “sent away ” It has always been the worst day of my year, until Last night, on October , , while sitting in my pj’s in a darkened apartment in Lahore, I tuned into Paris Hilton’s livestreams via Twitter and Paris Hilton was joined by members of the Breaking Code Silence team, Caroline Cole and Vanessa Hughes, to introduce the Accountability in Congregate Care Having been producing content for survivors of institutional abuse for the last year and urging folks to take action, I was thrilled and shocked to see how rapidly we’d made progress towards our goals: from the unprecedented exposure after the September release of Paris’ documentary the protest at Provo Canyon School the massification of our community and incorporation as a nonprofit ’s legislative victories in Utah, Missouri, Oregon, and California and a spate of program Our movement against the troubled teen industry has made tangible, significant That being said, I am most excited by the emergence and articulation of a new movement, more broadly defined, which was just introduced to the public in press conferences held in Washington DC . With representatives from the troubled teen industry survivors movement, foster care survivors, disability rights groups, and the LGBTQIA community, with an espoused commitment to centralize racial justice in our mission, and making the lived experiences of children and families the shared foundation for our organizing work, I believe we have the potential to build something much more revolutionary and I believe this new, broad coalition, the movement against children’s institutionalization (residential treatment centers, group homes, juvenile detention centers, therapeutic boarding schools, ranches, and military ) has opened a new political and articulatory space capable of engendering deep, systemic By recognizing the shared roots of problems facing children in the United States– in discourses and practices that stigmatize, demean, and disbelieve them– we can finally recognize the central role played by multiple, disparate institutions in causing real In doing so, we can propose comprehensive solutions that promote the social, civil, and legal rights of children and families everywhere, inside and outside of During the press conferences, the speakers touched on",startup,,nan,0.0

Our goal for the summer was to take a heavyweight version of the BlueROV2 from BlueRobotics and make it Over the summer we altered the hardware components of the drone, our biggest step being the addition of a ping For automation, we wrote code that was able to control the movement of the drone and looked into using OpenCV and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms to help with an automated navigation of the While we were mostly successful in our endeavor, we were inevitably unable to make our drone completely autonomous due to the hardware limitations of the BlueROV2 with the increasing demand of our By the end of the summer we decided we wanted to take what we learned about underwater robotics from the BlueROV2 and make our own drone that would better serve our hardware requirements for autonomous The concept of designing and building an autonomous underwater drone is very so we decided that we would join the RoboSub Competition to help challenge us and to give us a direction to go towards for our The process of making our group has heavily involved the restructure of our We transitioned our three teams of software, hardware and SLAM to be software, electrical, mechanical and To market our team better we decided to change our name from Autonomous Driving for Underwater Drones to Lehigh Underwater Robotics or LUR and developed a new logo and created a website and social media Our software team is implementing ROS code and algorithms into the drones’ automation instead of the Python scripts that we used over the More freedom has been given to our mechanical and electrical teams as they are designing the drone from scratch and are limited by the regulations of the competition, our budget and the needs of the software team for their Email Address Memorial Dr W, Bethlehem, PA Contact Us Copyright © a Theme by Gethugothemes This site uses By continuing to use this website, you agree to their I Accept   Sponsors Home About Us Our Story Projects RoboSub Summer of Technical Design Report Sponsors Contact Us Sponsors The Rossin College of Engineering, Lehigh University The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University The Mountaintop Creative Inquiry (MTCI) program, Lehigh University The Tayler gym, Lehigh University Get Lehigh Underwater Robotics sponsor packet Become a sponsor Email Address Memorial Dr W, Bethlehem, PA Contact Us Copyright © a Theme by Gethugothemes This site uses By continuing to use this website, you agree to their I Accept   Technical Design Report Home About Us Our Story Projects RoboSub Summer of Technical Design Report Sponsors Contact Us Technical Design Report Competition Strategy Team Makeup and workflow: The team is made up of four subteams: mechanical, electrical, software and business .
