Businesses want to be found by new customers, who need to know accurate locations, hours of operation, and other information about the places they want to visit. Application developers need affordable data without onerous legal restrictions or complicated deal terms. Currently, the best place data is very restrictive, expensive, and controlled by a small handful of companies. Quality varies globally, with data concentrated in the biggest markets and poor coverage elsewhere. Even the highest-quality data isn't fresh enough: who hasn't searched online for a store to find it closed or with different hours? Creating and maintaining a dataset like this is a very difficult problem. Restaurants open and close, a store changes hours, a doctor moves her practice across town, or a public building might close for temporary renovations. The StreetCred team has long experience with open mapping software and data and believes the time is right for a high-quality, permanent, decentralized solution to the place data problem. We are developing a protocol that will incentivize the collection and maintenance of data for the places people care about worldwide.

The technology enables consumers’ devices to track at high-frequency. In fact, the metrics gathered through this technology are 4 to 20 times more precise than, for instance, the ones of mobile apps that track performance. The flagship product of WHIP is WHIP LIVE, the mobile app that stands as a global community for runners, cyclists and motorcyclists who use WHIP’s technology to support, improve and connect their everyday sports experience. In 2018 WHIP LIVE was launched on the Apple App Store and Android Play Store. In 2020, after consistently improving the app, new for-purchase functions were added. WHIP LIVE is now the ultimate social network for outdoor sports enthusiasts, allowing to track, navigate, plan routes, explore trails and get 24/7 outdoor safety. All this, with the quality of a professional hardware, but with the connectivity and price of an App. WHIP also provides its technology and market intelligence for B2B projects with bike or moto manufacturers, brands, and event organizing committees.

The front and rear fascias slide open, functioning as secure front and rear storage cabinets. LeSEE’s interior uses innovative technologies to provide ultimate occupant comfort and convenience. When the user engages the vehicle’s Autonomous Mode, the steering wheel elegantly folds and retracts into the instrument panel, allowing for more room to relax and enjoy the journey.

Provenance of food is now a huge consideration for consumers. There is an increasing distrust of the industrial food supply chain and a trend amongst consumers to be more informed about the food quality. This trend has coincided with a loss of high street butchers and an increase in online shopping. This creates the perfect opportunity for The Ethical Butcher. Food Ethics and sustainability are topics which are increasingly important to the British public. The Ethical Butcher demonstrates that eating meat can be both healthy for the public and the environment if animals are kept properly. The Ethical Butcher will campaign against factory farming in preference for Pasture For Life and holistically managed animals. The Ethical Butcher's meat is free from growth hormones and antibiotics.   The Ethical Butcher will support the Pasture-Fed Livestock Association's campaign to challenge DEFRA’s (Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs) rules for food labelling with respect of grass-fed meat. Meat in the UK can be labelled as grass-fed if only 51% of its diet has been grass. This results in a very different product from 100% pasture fed meat. Pasture-fed animals are healthier, the meat is better for us and the carbon footprint is significantly reduced.  The British public has become more invested in their fitness, health and nutrition. The Ethical Butcher's 100% pasture fed meats offer a nutritionally superior product to factory farmed meats. Pasture fed meat does not cause the equivalent inflammation in the human body as low quality, factory farmed produce.

The world record is only 623 km/h for an electric aircraft, and the speed limit is about 1000 km/h. Our electric, plasma-based jet engines work differently. Instead of relying on electromagnetism like today's electric motors, they rely on thermodynamics like today's fuel-based jet engines. Usually, fuel is burned into the combustion chamber to heat the air at approximately 1700 °C, which generates CO2. The expansion of air due to the heat accelerates it toward the exhaust, where it generates thrust by leaving the engine at high speed. In our case, we use the same principle of heating the air to accelerate it. However, we heat it using electricity only, and we heat it so much that we generate a plasma, far above 2000 °C, without emitting CO2.",https://www.facebook.com/sylphaero,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Science and Engineering, Sustainability, Transportation",2,"Damien ENGEMANN, Tom BERNAT",1-10,1,Seed,2021-05-15,440000,EUR,534419,Pre-Seed,440000,EUR,534419,Pre-Seed,440000,EUR,534420,440000,EUR,534420,"Horizon Europe, La French Tech, European Space Agency, Réseau Entreprendre, Région Nouvelle-Aquitaine",1,6,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,

This got them thinking about whether they could come up with healthier alternatives that offered wholesome nutrition.

The duo got down to work and sought inspiration from traditional Indian foods and global health food trends.
