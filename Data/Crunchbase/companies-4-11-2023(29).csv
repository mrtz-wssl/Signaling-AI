It’s as essential as food and water. So much so that human connection is elemental to positive health outcomes. Perhaps this is why, when asked what patients want most from their healthcare experience, 85 percent of the surveyed said: “a doctor who listens.” That’s the essence of delivering patient-centered care—being responsive, respectful, and focused on our unique needs and values. Yet, even with the great strides and investments that we’ve made toward that end, delivering truly responsive, patient-centered care has proven elusive because of varied components, such as efficiency, effectiveness, care coordination, timing, and employee engagement, factor into the equation.  The truth is, patient experience is not limited to a single face-to-face interaction with a provider or care team. Instead, one’s healthcare journey is complex and touches upon a myriad opportunities to connect patients with providers, employees, and members across the continuum of care. Each interaction—good, bad, or somewhere in-between—intertwines with the overall human experience, patient outcomes, and, ultimately, the long-term success of healthcare providers. At Feedtrail, we believe delivering healthcare experiences that are exceptional, patient-centered, and profitable requires a new approach—one shaped by a comprehensive understanding of each person’s unique healthcare journey as it unfolds. It’s by capturing human interactions—as they occur in “real-time”—that we can strengthen human connections and advance better outcomes for patients, providers, employees, members, and the entire health economy. The Feedtrail Experience Management platform empowers healthcare organizations and their  teams of any size to engage with and learn from patients, clinical care providers, employees, and members instantly, at any point during the lifecycle of care. With advanced analytics and seamless EHR automations, Feedtrail facilitates multichannel interactions that are personalized to users and their care journey tied to specific business objectives. The platform makes it easy to capture healthcare encounters at the moment they occur so organizations can respond when it matters most. Our secure platform is easy to implement, requires no additional hardware or devices, and offers a user-friendly interface that fits seamlessly within any healthcare scenario. We reinforce this technology with deep domain expertise and unparalleled, end-to-end customer support that allows healthcare organizations to identify explicit opportunities for improvement across any number of service lines and act immediately to deliver higher-value experiences.",https://www.facebook.com/feedtrail,"Research Triangle, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Health Care, Software",4,"Jesse Haka, Matti Lehmus, Mikko Lehmus, Paul Jaglowski",11-50,6,,2021-05-24,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,2570000,USD,2570000,2670000,USD,2670000,"SaaS Ventures, Cofounders Capital, FCA Venture Partners, Cedars-Sinai Accelerator, Scott Garber",3,8,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-0.11%,51,,,26,,,,,175513,USD,175513

Their passion for cold brew coffee started years ago after graduating from college. At the time, both had corporate jobs, were training for a 24-hour obstacle race, and were running a group fitness company. Because of their busy schedules and drive to succeed, sleep became less important to them. In order to be their best, they needed something that could give them a quick jolt of energy. At first, they would drink anything that would keep them awake. As former college students, they started with what they knew - energy drinks. They quickly found that this was an extremely unhealthy option and one that would leave them with a hard crash once the sugar wore off. As they looked further into what was actually in these products they were disgusted at the amount of sugar and synthetic ingredients they were consuming. So, as any corporate employee would do, they turned to their trusty friend, coffee.  Every morning they would wake up 15 minutes early just to brew a pot of drip coffee, but just like everything else they tried, it had several drawbacks. The coffee took way too long to brew, produced a terrible tasting product, and wasn't convenient to take with them. Three things in their mind were unacceptable. In the summer of 2012, they stumbled upon cold brew coffee. It fulfilled all of their requirements for the perfect source of energy, it was natural, sugar-free, and simple, but there was one very significant drawback, it wasn't at all convenient. To make it on their own took them 24 hours and if they wanted to buy it they had to wait in line at a coffee shop. Over the next several years their love for cold brew grew, and so did their frustration with its lack of convenience and availability. They spent the next 2-years researching a way to create the highest quality product, in the most convenient way, and in 2015 they launched Bizzy - the healthiest and most convenient coffee on the market.",https://www.facebook.com/BizzyCoffee,"Greater Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage",2,"Alexander French, Andrew Healy",11-50,7,,2022-02-17,7100000,USD,7100000,Venture - Series Unknown,7100000,USD,7100000,Venture - Series Unknown,7150000,USD,7150000,7150000,USD,7150000,"Connetic Ventures, SOSV, Bluestein Ventures, Sidekick Partners, M25",2,7,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,11,,,17,,,,,16809,USD,16809

It is costly, infrequent, and only addresses those lines that are within reach. In fact, it is estimated that 40% of the world’s pipelines are unpiggable. The vulnerabilities between inspections, which are typically years apart, or the inability to conduct inspections at all, puts the world’s aging pipeline infrastructure at risk. In order to address these issues, we have focused on changing the economics, the technology, and the workflow associated with inline inspection. We have introduced the industry’s first self-serve inspection model that eliminates significant engineering and downtime costs. We have developed miniature, multi sensor Pipers® technology that freely flows within any and all active pipelines, regardless of location, condition, material or configuration. This technology is capable of inspecting pipelines as small as 2 inches in diameter, and surveying for leaks, geometric defects, magnetic anomalies, and deposits in a single run. Further, we have reduced the cost of inline inspection by a factor of 10, making it possible for integrity programs to be more present, more often, across all of their assets. Finally, such accessible technology has given us the opportunity to work with a complete range of clients – large and small, private and public – resulting in rich datasets libraries that offer unprecedented contextual analysis and continuous advancement of our data analytics capabilities. Our approach provides clients with uninterrupted access to up-to-date condition-critical data, allowing them to optimize planning, decision-making, and actions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Information Technology, Natural Resources, Privacy and Security, Sustainability",3,"Anouk van Pol, John van Pol, Yvonne van den Berg",11-50,6,Early Stage Venture,2019-10-30,6340000,CAD,4815726,Series A,6340000,CAD,4815726,Series A,8620528,CAD,6584111,8620528,CAD,6584111,"500 Global, Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), Chevron Technology Ventures, Energy Innovation Capital, T.

The core technology, a MEMS device called the Suspended Microchannel Resonator (SMR), is an exquisitely sensitive scale that can measure a small change in the weight of a single cancer cell. When cancer cells respond to cancer drugs, they start their process of dying by changing weight in just a few hours. The SMR can detect this tiny weight change.  As most cancer cells die naturally within 1-2 days of being removed from the human body, speed is critical to distinguish between natural cell death and cell death induced by a cancer drug.  It is this exquisite sensitivity that enables the SMR to detect a cancer cell’s response to a cancer drug while it is still a viable cell.

But it is also responsible for 6% of the European CO2 emissions. Despite the fact that fuel consumption accounts for more than 30% of the costs of a truck fleet operator, fuel management and optimization is often neglected because of missing transparency. Tracks is a Berlin-based startup founded in 2018 aiming to make road freight more efficient, safer, cleaner and fairer. After starting off with the advances of platooning, our team now leverages the power of artificial intelligence and big data to help the industry reduce their environmental footprint and increase efficiency. Thereby we are getting closer to our vision of a future powered by sustainable freight transport. We use artificial intelligence to analyze fleet performance to provide fleet owners of any size with real-time performance analytics to empower road freight companies to increase fuel efficiency to reduce their energy consumption and ecological footprint. This includes advanced performance analysis of single vehicles, transparent efficiency comparison between vehicles and recommendations tools with actionable insights to increase efficiency of their fleets and help them make better decisions , all in a single-view dashboard. This significantly improves the customers’ bottom line and strengthens their competitive advantage in the market. Furthermore, Tracks enables effective CO2 emissions management to increase transparency and sustainability for shippers. This includes automated carrier emissions reporting, transparent overview of their performance and advanced performance analysis of single vehicles.

Spotr.ai monitors and inspects over 250.000 buildings in the Netherlands and recently launched in the UK with 10 prominent UK housing corporations that will start inspecting their real estate portfolios with Spotr’s software solution. Spotr.ai offers a platform for banks, insurance companies, large real-estate owners, and the government to monitor building characteristics in a fast, precise, and easily accessible platform. This contributes to optimizing their client’s portfolios and activities. “It’s about knowing and understanding your portfolio.” Says Dirk Huibers, CEO at Spotr.ai. “Think of the dimensions, quantities, and conditions of buildings and their specific components. This information is crucial to make smart decisions when achieving sustainability goals. But it’s also about asking yourself the basic questions. On which buildings can you place external wall insulation? How many floors does a building have? Can you still reach that high floor with a fire truck? Are there trees close to the gutters that could cause water damage? You need accurate data to make the right decisions for your portfolio and wallet. And that data simply doesn’t exist today.”  With only 8% of buildings currently being inspected every year due to budget and time constraints of building owners and facility managers, there’s much to gain. “It’s our ambition to inspect every building in the world every year,” says Huibers. “In the largest global sector in the world, a small deviation can have a major impact on maintenance costs and valuations. Our smart software can make better, faster, and cheaper budget estimations than humans alone, which makes us a reliable and trustworthy partner.”",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Dirk Huibers, Marieke Dijksma, Tara Campagne",11-50,1,Seed,2021-06-15,2500000,EUR,3031405,Seed,2500000,EUR,3031405,Seed,2500000,EUR,3031405,2500000,EUR,3031405,"InnovationQuarter, Volta Ventures, Concrete Venture Capital",1,3,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.26%,26,4,,,0,3,,Building; repairs,,,

Stylumia leverages machine learning to improve product assortments, optimise inventory management, and offers the most accurate consumer-driven fashion forecast in the industry.   Stylumia customers from the fashion, lifestyle, home & sports industries range from the Fortune 100 list to small and medium brands and retailers. Stylumia serves them through their suite of proprietary solutions powered by machine learning-based prediction algorithms, computer vision and award-winning proprietary Demand Science™. This is a radical approach compared to the supply-driven or intuitive fashion prediction and fashion forecasting systems available in the market globally. Most analyses focus on what is in the market already and is therefore flawed, being more an indicator of what was supplied and not what is selling well.

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models. Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community.
