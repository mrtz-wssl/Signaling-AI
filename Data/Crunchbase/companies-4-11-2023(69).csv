If you’re a professional athlete you have all these great tools and coaching staff to track your activity, monitor your output and improve your game. Unfortunately nothing like that exists at the amateur level. You will hear professional coaches talk about how hard a player worked, how fast he is and even how much of an endurance athlete he is. It’s really weird to think that in 2015 this sort of data has existed at an elite level for over a decade now but the technology hasn’t filtered down to the amateur sporting arena. After a couple of years of trial and error and tech development, Sports Performance Tracking launched GameTraka™ in January 2015 at Las Vegas CES show. GameTraka™ is a web-based sports performance tracking platform and has been designed and developed with sub-elite athletes and amateur players in mind. The ability for technology to filter down to grass roots sporting level and allow YOU to track, measure and monitor your physical performance based on facts. SPT has worked extremely hard at establishing itself as a leader in the local sporting community and strives for greatness in this area. We are currently selling our GPS platform across multiple sports and have customers in 19 countries (United States, Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Kenya, Japan, Italy, Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, Qatar, India and Algeria) across all 7 continents.

Our customers can order once or sign up for subscriptions of milk, eggs, dairy, meats, vegetables, and fruits on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. All food will be fresh and locally acquired.    All our products are sourced from local growers or aggregators. If not available due to seasonality, they will still be procured through a local aggregator. Our short logistics cycle enables vine and tree ripened foods to be brought from the farm to your door within 48 hours.  The goal is to have the shortest distance between you and your food so you can eat it the way nature intended. Get it fresh, get it local, taste the difference. The truly hyper-local sources along with our expansion into a food marketplace is what sets us apart from competitors.  We bring local bakeries with their fresh breads and bagels right to your door.  We also offer fresh pastas and pasta sauces along with fresh juices and hand carved meats from local butchers straight to you.  It saves you time and allows you to enjoy the quality and freshness of these locally famous businesses from the convenience of your home.  Deliveries are dropped off at your front door and can be retrieved whenever convenient.

Founded by a Stanford neuroscientist and a father of 2 young boys, our first product is Wunder, which is the first personalized, science-based platform to help new parents lead their little ones learning journey through play, imagination, and collaborative curiosity.  The first idea for Oyalabs came about when our founder's first son was born with a congenital medical condition and he was looking for a science-based resource for parents to ensure they are stimulating not just physical but also cognitive development of their child - knowing 0-3 is the most critical period for intervention as 90% of the brain grows then.  After positive results from a clinical study, in Summer 2017, we created Wunder to help harness predictive technologies to build tools to nurture not only Lamont’s own sons, as well as something meaningful and impactful for all families. Our technology has been shown to improve a child's language and cognitive outcomes in a research trial and has won the Best of BabyTech Learn & Play award at CES 2018.   Based on the data and interactive curriculum in the Wunder app, the platform recommends parents age-appropriate activities, books and toys to teach and motivate parents to provide the most stimulating learning experience for their everyday bonding.

People who have a hearing loss greater than 90dB are guided to use cochlear implant instead of hearing aids to restore hearing. Our goal is to expand the cochlear implant market globally. Because of the high price, cochlear implants are usually consumed in the developed countries such as North America and Europe. However, majority of the hearing-impaired population currently resides in the developing or underdeveloped countries where people cannot afford the benefit of the cochlear implant. This high price of the cochlear implant is mostly due to the manual method of manufacturing the neural electrodes. To replace the conventional manual fabrication method, TODOC has developed automated micro-machining electrode manufacturing processes at only 1/10 of conventional manufacturing cost of electrode, as well as the cochlear implant system. The automated electrode manufacturing processes can offer higher capacities for a wider range of sounds to the hearing impaired than conventional ones.

These channels require detailed descriptive content about the hotels, highlighting their features, amenities, services, and facilities. Distressingly, the content currently available is incomplete and even inaccurate, misleading, and obsolete. Hotel Data Cloud (HDC) is a content distribution platform that enables hotels to easily share detailed content and comprehensive information in a standardized, globally consistent format. HDC captures over 600 attributes per property, multilingual descriptions, images with corresponding metadata and also temporary changes, such us undergoing renovations. This reduces manual workload and lets hotels efficiently control the narrative of their listing across all booking channels, improving their discoverability and leading to increased bookings and revenue. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are applied to generate personalized content and smart recommendations. Travel companies can access this content through HDC's data feed, allowing them to provide detailed, consistent and reliable information to their customers. All connected channels are immediately updated, which eliminates the need for hotels to perform redundant manual updates of various extranets. With an unrivaled depth of information, travel companies can fine-tune their hotel search functions with better filtering options, provide better recommendations and address customers with personalized offers that are tailored to their individual requirements. This ultimately allow travelers to make smarter booking and arrive well informed without anxiety and uncertainty.

With our concept we differentiate ourselves from existing health apps and wearables by adding a personal connection and human-to-human interaction with a professional. We’re all about making this world fit and healthy. The problem with most existing health apps or wearable devices is that they are just that: apps and devices. There’s no human-to-human contact, while that has been shown as the most effective when it comes to reaching your health goals. For most people, a real personal trainer is also way too expensive ($25 up to $400/hour), Fitmo makes coaches affordable (from $8/month) and within reach of everyone. We connect you to a coach who fits you and your health goals. Your coach will push you to the limit and help you reach these goals. Coaches can monetize their free time and coach up to 50 people via the Fitmo platform. Text and video messaging, combined with interactive, updated training schedules and the possibility to import data from different wearables, makes it easy for coaches to keep up with their clients and help them in the right direction. Fitmo enables them to do their job at scale and to be more affordable to more people than traditional personal coaches.
