Our founding team spent the initial months at the field to understand the customer pain-points. We realised that the fragmented sensing solutions’ market was overpopulated with sensors that were nothing near field ready. To take these to the field, one would have to invest in numerous integrations, time and engineering resources.  We decided to build to fill the void that these myopic sensors left in the market. In our effort to provide intelligent sensing that integrates multiple sensors, was weather and terrain agnostic, we developed CRON’s very own Smart Sensor Fusion platform. This platform is designed to flawlessly fuse data from different types of sensors. Simply put, it combines the information from multiple sensors to help perceive the environment and if/when one sensor is compromised by the terrain or the weather conditions, another sensor jumps into action. With little to no false alarms, accurate object/human detection, tracking and classification our advanced suite of products and technology solutions are designed to augment situational awareness i.e. makes you fully aware of the environment around you.

From providing revenues and market research to invoicing, post-production, and delivery, Meero takes care of all the laborious, time-consuming tasks which plague the industry.  Above all, the company aims to provide them with tools for file compatibility, CRM, marketing, and other daily needs. In addition to this, they'll have access to a series of educational masterclasses, inspiring documentaries, meetups with photographers in 35 different countries, a magazine in 2 different languages, and even a foundation supporting photography worldwide.

The cutting-edge content enrichment technologies the company is currently developing can reduce this time to a few seconds, solving the problems of long delivery times, inconsistent photo rendering and unfair prices. Meero further gives artists the chance to work with major brands and take advantage of a whole range of solutions that simplify their work and make the production of beautiful images far easier. These innovations allow brands, and soon individual consumers, to access made-to-measure photo and video solutions around the world. Meero manages the photoshoot process from beginning to end, guaranteeing unbeatable prices, delivery times of less than 24 hours and professional photo quality.

We are building, India’s first socially distributed full stack fintech platform for middle class families in tier 2-4 cities. The financial needs of small-city India have been largely underserved since traditional players and even fintechs are unable to properly serve this segment * WeRize is a full-stack provider, both manufacturing and distributing a wide portfolio of customized credit, insurance, and savings products for 300Mn individuals spread across the 4000+ Tier 2 to Tier 4 towns . This $200 Billion market expects a very different product set as well as distribution model which traditional private banks, insurers, and mutual fund companies are unable to provide. The economics of these products as well as operating in small cities for traditional companies is unfeasible due to their high-cost branch-based distribution model. * Families in small towns require high touch sales/after-sales service which can only be profitably provided using a social distribution model. The entire Indian fintech ecosystem is geared towards building DIY apps that help customers choose the right financial products for themselves. However, this approach doesn’t work for small-town families as they need high touch sales and after sales. Additionally, due to lower ticket-size/conversions vs tier-1 city millennial customers, digital CAC unit economics dont work, leading to fintechs staying away from this superb segment *Using the “Social Shopify of Finance” platform, WeRize has enabled thousands of financially literate freelancers in 1000+ cities to sell its financial products in their social circle. This solves trust issue as well as provides high-touch sales/after-sales . * Werize is the only Indian fintech platform/financial services player that has been able to distribute financial services through freelancers without any of its own feet-on-street/local branches. Our freelancers in 1000+ cities are managed only through Werize proprietary tech platform.

Intrommune’s therapies are delivered through a platform that integrates simply into a person’s daily routine to enable them and their loved ones to live their lives without fear. The Company’s Oral Mucosal Immunotherapy (OMIT) platform is based on the well-accepted principles of immunotherapy. OMIT utilizes a specially formulated toothpaste that optimizes exposure of allergenic proteins to a patient’s immune system, while cleaning their teeth. The initial product in development is INT301 for the treatment of peanut allergy. The lack of treatments makes food allergies an area of tremendous unmet need. The FDA has only approved one product for any food allergy, a peanut allergy immunotherapy that requires you to ingest peanut protein. As desperate as patients are for solutions, due to significant adverse events and difficulty in administration, only 1 in 10 eligible patients are willing to ingest peanut protein. Nonetheless, the company was recently acquired for $2.6 billion. With minimal options, patients and caregivers must resort to attempting to avoid allergy-triggering foods in the often-futile hope of preventing severe allergic reactions. In short, patients, parents, providers and payors are all seeking a safe, efficacious, and easy to administer product such as INT301. Intrommune Therapeutics’ Phase 1b study in individuals with peanut allergy is on-going and is on a development timeline with significant near-term value inflection events expected over the next 12 months",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Danya Glabau, Erick Berglund, Michael Nelson",1-10,5,Early Stage Venture,2022-02-08,,,,Series B,,,,Series B,6150000,USD,6150000,6150000,USD,6150000,"Red Bear Angels, Timberline Investments, Chemical Angel Network, Robin Hood Ventures",1,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2021-09-08,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,

People have insufficient control over their data. It is frequently unclear when and where data about them is being captured or used and when it is, they are being compensated poorly or not at all and have to trust the companies using it to keep it private. Yet, much of the world is fuelled by person-based data — from social and marketing research to advertising, finance, and insurance — data about individuals and populations drives everything from product development to public policy. Measure democratizes access to accurate data about individuals and populations while allowing people to maintain sovereignty over their data. Measure does this by introducing a new blockchain-based protocol that facilitates the network and infrastructure to form a marketplace. On one side of the market are individuals who contribute data by completing tasks, surveys or providing access to data sources such as health and location data. On the other side are buyers of person-based data, such as marketers, researchers and advertisers. Between them is software and a public blockchain that allows buyers to interact directly with individuals in a way that protects the privacy of the individual, incentivizes accuracy, and provides transparency around data usage and payment. A primary goal of the protocol is to maximize the supply of accurate, representatively sampled data about individuals. It features a simple, standardized pricing model indexed by scarcity and complexity, a reputation system for both buyers and contributors that encourages efficient survey design and good faith participation, and a set of economic incentives to encourage data reuse.",https://www.facebook.com/measureprotocol,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Software",4,"John Martin, Owen Hanks, Paul Neto, Prashanth Ravindran",1-10,2,,2022-04-19,2600000,GBP,3383632,Venture - Series Unknown,2600000,GBP,3383632,Venture - Series Unknown,4600000,GBP,6006927,4600000,GBP,6006927,"Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), Dynata, Blackfinch Ventures, Italian Angels for Growth, Blockchain Valley Ventures",2,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,133.85%,44,1,"13,877",,,,,,213510,USD,213510

We have a holistic understanding of all aspects of the value chain from brain activity to product integration. This value chain includes: (1) innovative biosensor development, (2) custom hardware design; (3) data collection and analysis; and (4) product integration. IDUN Technologies integrates neuroscience into every-day product designs, enabling connected devices to understand the emotional needs of people, providing for happier and more fulfilling product experiences. IDUN achieves this by delivering the full neurofeedback value chain from electrode manufacturing to product design integration. This allows the brain waves of an individual to be comfortably characterized through-out the day to understand their unique emotional needs. Through the IDUN API, actional inputs are sent to connected devices, providing more interactive and fulfilling product experiences. Our goal is to fuse emotion intelligence with connected devices, enabling cohesion and understanding between humans and the connected world. Electroencephalography (EEG) imaging of the brain allows us to characterize the way in which our brain processes information. From EEG signals we extract features related to the emotional and cognitive loads of people. While EEG recording has been used in controlled laboratory environments for decades, it has not been integrated into consumer devices that seamlessly integrate with daily life. We believe that daily measurements of the brain will unlock insights that are not possible with only laboratory measurements. Each brain is unique, with its own algorithm that we are focused on decoding. We translate EEG biomarkers from research findings into our product design and build upon research by developing tests that empirically characterize the brain activity resulting from specific environmental inputs. The goal is to not simply provide the end user with a recording of their brain as a complex data stream, but to give them actionable insights, or passively change their digital experience to better suit their brain state.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Simon Bachmann, Séverine Chardonnens",11-50,6,Seed,2021-09-02,2000000,CHF,2186884,Seed,2000000,CHF,2186884,Seed,2650000,CHF,2836342,4210000,CHF,4470018,"Sony, Venture Kick, Joyance Partners, Serpentine Ventures, CADFEM",3,10,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,4,7,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

By developing solid-state production methods to improve electrodes, the company produces batteries using less energy, materials, and equipment. Intecells is breaking manufacturing out of its decades-long stasis toward a future full of new products and capabilities. Founded in 2018, Intecells invented solid-state printing techniques leveraging cold plasma to fundamentally change the way electrodes are shaped and built into flexible cell formats. The company is revolutionizing what is possible not only for manufacturing and environmental impact but also for consumer product creation for years to come. Partnering with leading battery makers, OEMs, and academic institutions, Intecells plans to bring its innovations from lab to production in 2022. The startup is the brainchild of Dr. Shawn Gayden, a Chinese American inventor, and business executive, who led battery manufacturing research for more than a decade, and Christian Buske, a German entrepreneur whose company first commercialized cold plasma technology decades ago. Intecells’ technologies eliminate binders and solvents for a cleaner electrode-making process, thereby opening new paths for a wide range of cell chemistries and applications across sectors at low production costs.     This game-changing endeavor is a rising tide that lifts everyone in the value chain. For materials and equipment suppliers, collaborating with Intecells adds value to products; for cell manufacturers, applying Intecells’ technology means they can write the rules for future battery production; and for OEMs, Intecells innovations eliminate many traditional and costly design constraints.  By adapting proven cold plasma technology to solve new problems, Intecells’ technology allows the battery to follow product form, not the other way around. The company’s new technology shrinks battery size, with limitless possibilities for shape, while retaining the same power output for less money. In the short term, Intecells is working to demonstrate its flexible batteries that offer personalization for a new wave of consumer products.  The company’s long-term goal is to revolutionize the electric vehicle battery industry and accelerate renewable energy storage. Today, the company creates bespoke technology for customers seeking to improve manufacturing processes and economic outcomes.",,"Greater Detroit Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Manufacturing",2,"Christian Buske, Xiaohong Gayden",1-10,1,Seed,2019-07-16,1999999,USD,1999999,Seed,1999999,USD,1999999,Seed,1999999,USD,1999999,1999999,USD,1999999,Walden International,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondria are at the heart of complex life's origin. Likely a bacterium at the time, the would-be-organelle merged with a simple organism, entering into a symbiotic relationship: The mitochondria began supplying the energy for elaborate cellular functions to evolve, while the organism provided the mitochondria with an environment to thrive. Today, mitochondria are found in all human cells, except for red blood cells. They take on a pivotal role in cellular fate, as they produce most of the energy (ATP) and are involved in a large number of cellular and metabolic processes. The density of the organelles is particularly high in cells requiring a lot of cellular energy - e.g. cardiomyocytes or brain cells. Mitochondria function, and hence energy supply to the cell, may be impaired due to acute insults (e.g. ischemia) or genetic disorders (e.g. LOHN). Researchers at Harvard University developed an approach for mitochondria augmentation and replacement to ameliorate the damages from ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Ischemia is a lack of blood flow leading to an undersupply of oxygen and an impairment of mitochondria function. Reperfusion describes the re-introduction of blood flow, inducing an oversupply of oxygen. Both, ischemia and reperfusion, damage cells, with the mitochondria dysfunction being at the heart of the injury. The cascade of events, from ischemia to reperfusion, will eventually lead to cell death. The most prominent acute conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury are heart attacks. At Cellvie, we are developing a means to transplant viable mitochondria into the compromised cells, to interrupt the said cascade of events, re-enabling the cells to turn oxygen into energy via the mitochondria.",,"Greater Houston Area, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,"Alexander Schueller, James McCully, Pedro del Nido, Sitaram Emani",1-10,2,Seed,2023-02-06,5500000,USD,5500000,Seed,5500000,USD,5500000,Seed,10500000,USD,10500000,10500000,USD,10500000,"Taiho Ventures, KIZOO Technology Capital",2,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-5.38%,4,,,,2,0,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,,9291,USD,9291

Fetah from Örebro in 2019. Before starting Refurbly, David worked in mobile phone repair in the family-owned store on Drottninggatan. He had a vision to change the mobile phone market by creating a circular and sustainable mobile phone ownership. Refurbly's focus on sustainability has created a platform for customers to buy high-quality used mobile phones at an affordable price, while making a positive impact on the environment. It is known that the production of a new mobile phone requires many environmentally harmful substances, such as gold, cobalt, copper, lithium, and rare earth metals. These metals are found in very low concentrations and are therefore difficult and expensive to extract from the ore. The production of a new mobile phone accounts for nearly 75-80% of the phone's emissions over its entire lifespan. By choosing a used mobile phone from Refurbly, customers can reduce their carbon footprint by up to 80%. This is easy to do with the help of Refurbly. Every mobile phone sold on Refurbly has undergone strict tests performed by their own service technicians to ensure that it is in top condition. This way, customers can feel confident that they are buying a mobile phone that works just like a new phone. Refurbly has grown significantly in 2022 and continues to expand in 2023. With names like Johan Dennelind, former CEO of Telia, supporting their green transition, Refurbly is well positioned to be a leader in sustainable mobile technology in the future. Refurbly is more than just an e-commerce platform for used mobile phones. The company also offers an environmentally certified mobile phone subscription, which is good for customers who want to make responsible choices and take care of their environment.
