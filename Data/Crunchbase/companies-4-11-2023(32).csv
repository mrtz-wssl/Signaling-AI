The SnifferDRONE collects a corpus of methane concentration (PPM) data at the ground surface, with location coordinates, in an efficient and effective manner.

Though the SnifferDRONE was initially developed for the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill market (the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the US according to the EPA), it is also applicable for other land-based applications found in the renewable natural gas, mining, and other markets.  Because of the SnifferDRONE’s ability to locate more leak locations, MSW sites are also successfully using the system to aid in the reduction of landfill odors.

The company is leveraging its DIMERx™ technology to address the problem of visceral hypersensitivity and pancreatitis in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and the unmet medical needs in the treatment of both peripheral neuropathic and systemic nociceptive pain. The lead candidate ORP-101 is a peripherally acting sodium ion channel blocker (Nav 1.7), mu agonist/kappa antagonist dimer. The molecule does not cross the blood brain barrier and, unlike other opioids that constrict the sphincter of Oddi, ORP-101, when given intravenously in animal studies, has instead been shown to relax the sphincter. The former attribute implies no abuse potential and the latter minimizes the risks of pancreatitis and/or abdominal pain related to sphincter of Oddi constriction. These two attributes, in combination with the well-understood pharmacology of ORP-101, make the molecule a suitable candidate for chronic treatment of conditions associated with visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia. Therefore we have positioned ORP-101 for two non-overlapping indications: the oral form for colonic hyperalgesia and gastric dysmotility in IBS-D and the parenteral form for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential clinical benefits are backed by compelling data from validated animal models. The company is also developing potent non-opioid and opioid conjugates to treat acute and chronic nociceptive pain. The non-opioid analgesic conjugate is designed to be non-ulcerogenic and liver-safe and, therefore, has the potential to reshape the pain market served by acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Similarly, the opioid conjugate is designed to be orally active and have a lower potential for dependence than currently available opioids. DIMERx™ technology results in conjugates designed to preserve the receptor pharmacology of their individual constituents, but to have therapeutic profiles well suited for different clinical indications. The components of the conjugates have all been previously proven to be safe and effective for other indications and, therefore, the conjugates have reduced developmental risks. The DIMERx™ conjugates are considered to be new molecular entities and have composition of matter intellectual property protection.",https://www.facebook.com/pages/Orphomed-Inc/695969723880050,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Frank Steinberg, Nikhilesh Singh, Pankaj Pasricha",11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,2017-05-24,39000000,USD,39000000,Series A,39000000,USD,39000000,Series A,39000000,USD,39000000,41816012,USD,41816012,"New Enterprise Associates, Takeda Ventures, Pappas Capital, Relativity Healthcare Partners, Mario Family Funds",2,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,11,,,,,,,

Veteran founded and owned we focus on supporting users in remote, exposed on challenging environments, including police, service personnel, first responders and NGOs. We’re active in both the UK and US.  Hybrid human-machine teams will be much more effective in protecting assets, people & planet at scale. For that to happen, we need our technology to be able to operate without depending on human attention or on vulnerable infrastructure. We specialise in advanced artificial intelligence (AI) for cameras and GNSS-denied navigation for manned and unmanned systems.     Real time remote monitoring is difficult to achieve with people alone. The areas are often huge and distant, meaning hard-working maintenance, security or safety staff have poor coverage with long response times. Pipeline security, anti-poaching, asset integrity monitoring and border patrol are a few examples. Whilst we (humankind) have developed an impressive array of technologies, including drones and ground sensors, these remain tools to use at long range. These tools are dependent on: 1) human attention to make best use of them and 2) infrastructure to support them, with communications and positional information in particular.  GPS has become increasingly easy to jam and to spoof. Not only that but the orbital infrastructure itself is at direct risk of vandalism. Archangel Imaging provides a complimentary solution stack to enable human-machine team work in the real world. These make machines smarter, more resilient in a changing situation and easier to work with in a human workflow.  Xnaut AI co-pilots enable existing uncrewed drones, boats and rovers to make mission level navigation decisions based on live observed context. Designed to work when GPS is being spoofed or jammed, Xnaut GENIE Uniquely combines over 50 navigation methods to ensure reliable, resilient and accurate location data is provided to the system's autopilot.   Argonaut smart cameras have been designed to operate independent of infrastructure. The camera and tower products are fully self-contained, with power, communications, sensors and compute.

The idea came to life after recognizing an existing problem - the disconnect between customers and businesses in the hospitality industry. Loyal customers are absolutely essential, yet not a single venue knows how many customers actually return and how to make sure this rate increases. The problem is being exposed even more during the current staff crisis and challenges that bars, restaurants and cafes face nowadays. Embargo allows both the businesses and customers build long term relationships providing added value to each other. The app for customers is a user friendly tool that counts visits automatically from the moment the customer enters the venue. The venue can reward a regular customers without hoping that their staff will recognize such customer.

Our SaaS solution enables banks and microfinance organizations to instantly and accurate underwrite loans, both offline and digitally, to consumers with limited or no credit history. zypl's proprietary approach includes training AI models on synthetically generated data with simulation of 'black swan' conditions, providing stable and adaptable SaaS in spite of macro volatility in developing markets. Apart from analyzing traditional variables such as social, demographic, and professional background of clients, our SaaS reviews device metadata, psychometrics, web trace, and macroeconomic factors to arrive at credit decisions. In the process, we fully customize AI models to risk appetite of each individual enterprise partner with the goal of reflecting their competitive market advantages. Additionally, we offer complete flexibility on mode of integration through either cloud or on-premise deployment based on enterprise preference. We only deploy explainable AI models with embedded 'weight-of-evidence' interpretation of each decision made by the software, complying with emerging regulatory requirements on credit scoring. Having launched our beta last year, we have scaled presence to 10 enterprise clients in 4 markets across Central Asia. In this time, we have underwritten >$9 million in consumer and small business (services, trade, agriculture) loans to over 12 thousand consumers with staggeringly low 0.7% portfolio-at-risk rate. Since booking first revenue earlier this year, we have surpassed 25% compounded monthly growth rate and reached financial break-even this month. As a complement to credit scoring, our product team has ventured into churn prediction in telecom sector through partnerships with 3 leading telcos in Central Asia. Our rapid product iteration and development is a result of an AI Academy that we have launched to nurture talent internally. zypl.ai was ideated at Stanford University's Startup Garage and recently completed the Silkway Accelerator by Google for Startups and Astana Hub. Our startup was launched with a grant from the Islamic Development Bank as part of the Transform Fund.

CAST AI's intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of the project, cluster, namespace, and deployment, down to individual microservices. CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster.

RelGen captures the spinning force of the vehicle’s drive shaft through a custom center bearing. A belt transmits this kinetic energy to an alternator where it is converted into electricity. It is stored for later use to power almost any accessory – like electric APU’s, liftgates, autonomous truck sensors, cameras. The technology benefits heavy commercial truck fleets that utilize battery power for accessories. Long-haul drivers need cab climate systems to live and work comfortably. Fleets whose drivers use liftgates to deliver products and services need battery power too.  RelGen is the fastest charging system on the market and allows users to reduce fuel and maintenance costs related to engine idling and helps fleets increase uptime and profits while eliminating tonnes of CO2 per truck per year. The Energy and Combustion Research Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Lowell analyzed our data from customer trucks to assess fuel savings and emissions reductions. Their results confirm our industry value: One Year ROI, eliminates engine idle on trucks with liftgates saves 3-5 gallons of diesel per day resulting in $3,000 saved per truck per year.

When will the vehicle go out of charge? What is the optimal route? These are questions that arise every day when driving an EV. And these just get a lot worse if we are not talking about individual vehicles but 100s of them like electric van delivery fleets, public transport with e-buses or e-car company fleets. For them, electric vehicles are much more expensive and difficult to operate than normal petrol or diesel ones, not to mention the constant fear of running out of charge with 100s of vehicles at the same time. Volteum solves these issues for them every day. At Volteum our goal is to enable every company to use EVs as easily, effectively and economically as internal combustion engine vehicles. For this we are developing a software with which fleet operators can optimize their vehicles every day. The product has three main pillars: Firstly, we model and predict the energy consumption and the battery state of charge along the routes with our EV simulation engine. Secondly, based on this we plan optimal trips for the vehicles taking into account the charging needs, time, distance and costs as well. Thirdly, we also manage the daily tasks of the fleet and optimize their operation based on live data. With Volteum electric fleets save money as we optimize their fleet composition, the daily tasks, routes and the charging needs cost-effectively. They can also make sure none of the vehicles will go out of charge thanks to our simulation engine. Last but not least we save loads of human resources, manual calculations and planning with our algorithms. With this we can ensure that all tasks and routes will be covered just as easily and comfortably as with their old vehicles.",https://facebook.com/volteumapp,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Software, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",3,"Dávid Kertész, Kornél Kálmán, Zsófia Tóth",11-50,2,Seed,2022-11-09,1250000,EUR,1252420,Seed,1250000,EUR,1252420,Seed,1372421,USD,1372421,1372421,USD,1372421,"Techstars, Techstars Ventures, Day One Capital, Jared Schrieber, Fiedler Capital",2,6,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19,1,,,0,0,,Advertising; business,,,
