Even if you do get a fair price, the inconvenience of meeting the buyer, negotiating the price, shipping the asset, and waiting for payment could be an exhausting process. And then there is the worry of figuring out what happens to the data on your device. This is why NorthLadder came to be. We are the region’s only auction-driven selling platform for pre-owned electronics devices- a thoughtfully created service where people can sell their devices to a network of global buyers and get cash instantly in a safe, dignified, and hassle-free manner. But that’s not all. We have many convenient drop-off locations across the region for getting instant cash against your devices. Don’t want to drop off your device? No worries, we will come to your doorstep to pick it up and hand the cash over to you. And if you want your data to be erased, we can advise you on ways to do it or use internationally approved software to erase it for a small fee. We have served thousands of customers and their overwhelmingly positive feedback tells us we are on the right track. Our efforts actively contribute to the formation of a circular economy, which is the need of the day.

Rob and Mariel bring unmatched celebrity styling expertise (Jennifer Lopez, Emily Ratajkowski, Cara Delevingne, Gwen Stefani) along with design prowess working with world renowned luxury brands to assure Privé Revaux’s premium quality. With over 100 handcrafted and polarized designer frames, each costing $29.95, Privé Revaux Eyewear is a purveyor of quality goods at a great value.

To accomplish our mission, we have created a platform that allows the creation of 'Living Assets' - NFTs that can be traded freely among users, but whose properties are regulated by their initial creators.

Our customers have a dual problem:(1) improve the efficiency of their development process along the DevOps cycle and (2) deal with security requirements against data leaks. These two problems are usually solved separately. Improved alignment is achieved with solutions to manage containers for development. Security against data leaks is achieved with infrastructure such as VDI or DaaS. Strong Network's platform achieves these goals jointly, with superior benefits, but most importantly with security that doesn't get in the way of developers' productivity. In contrast to DaaS streaming desktops, our platform delivers a low-bandwidth, locally executing development environment with frontend and backend security resulting in higher ROI and productivity, and improved security posture.
