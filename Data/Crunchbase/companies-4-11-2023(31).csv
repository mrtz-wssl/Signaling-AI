As personal DNA sequencing has risen in popularity, the data has become siloed as each company looks to maximize their individual profit from this data.

Now I have it, I’m in love with it. I am in project management, so on top of managing myself I have to manage a lot of others. While I have to-do systems such as Trello and Asana, most of those to-dos are spurred from emails (or an email that has a lot of information)."" ""I’ve tried setting up folders and didn’t work. It made it so hard until now. Drag, simply put, is awesome. I can now run my inbox like I do my tasks inside Trello.” “We’ve previously used tools such as Wunderlist, Asana, Evernote, Todoist, Any.do, Trello and Sortd however they’re all focused on managing Tasks inside a tool. I need to manage my tasks inside my email. Booooom, then Drag came a long. Honestly, it’s the most productive Chrome extension I’ve used in years. Thanks Drag, I’m an official Dragster now!” “Email is the perennial problem for me, because I want to use it as a todo list, but I also want a zero inbox. I’m a huge fan of Trello, it is the most productive workspace I have today.  So when I saw Drag, the light went on and I am now unable to live without it.” “We’ve tried them all from Trello, Asana, Evernote through to Sortd and others. Drag complements my use of Trello perfectly. I don’t want all Tasks inside Trello so to run my Gmail separately works amazingly well.” How does Drag compare to other tools?  If you’re considering what Task Management or Project Management tools you should be using in your spare time and improve what you’re doing, there’s a lot of options.  From regular old spreadsheets to manage Tasks to specific Kanban boards of software, sales and marketing. There are dozens of solutions (we love Trello) and Drag works perfectly with them. Don’t replace your main tools, instead use Drag to apply the same principles of being efficient with tasks, inside your inbox.  www.dragapp.com ",https://www.facebook.com/dragapp,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",2,"Eduarda Bardavid, Nick Timms",11-50,3,Seed,2021-02-01,2000000,BRL,368141,Seed,2000000,BRL,368141,Seed,488141,USD,488141,488141,USD,488141,"Techstars, Gvangels, Florian Hagenbuch, The Future Fund, Urca Angels",2,8,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,72.44%,80,1,,30,,,,,,,

Ohanae Web3 equity crowdfunding and trading platform is analogous to an electric car vs. a petrol-powered car. Our platform uses innovative Web3 technology and a regulatory framework modeled after the SEC Statement on “Custody of Digital Asset Securities by Special Purpose Broker-Dealers”. Similar to how electric cars use batteries and electric motors instead of combustion engines (the incumbents), we are confident that our platform will provide investors with a more efficient and transparent way to invest in private companies, and, subsequently, trade assets via the ATS. Ohanae Securities LLC, (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ohanae, Inc.) is currently seeking approval from FINRA to qualify as a special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) performing broker-dealer functions with respect to digital asset securities – including maintenance and custody of these assets – in a manner that addresses the unique attributes of digital asset securities while minimizing risk to investors and other market participants. Ohanae Securities will limit its business to digital asset securities to isolate risk adopting policies and procedures to, among other things, assess a given digital asset security’s distributed ledger technology and protect the private keys necessary to transfer the digital asset security. Ohanae is launching a Regulation A+ offering of Class B common stock which, will be offered—for $5.00 per share (the “Offering”). The Offering is being conducted on a “best-efforts” basis, with a maximum amount of $30 million, and it will be open one year from the date of qualification, unless the Company raises the amount sooner.

Life365 provides a cloud based Virtual Care platform that bundles connected Life365 and partner solutions, with services to streamline connectivity and solution deployment outside the point of care. Life365 enables a friction free experience to support and promote scalability: integration to the clinical workflow, patient stratification, enrollment and engagement, decision support, and logistics, on a much-needed single connection point for remote / virtual care.  The Life365 platform offers a variety of tools to connect care providers with patients who can benefit from managing their health at home. Our Remote Health Monitoring solutions enable care professionals to proactively address patient health conditions and avoid costly care utilization including ER incidents and hospitalization. Our solutions are ideal to address the needs of Accountable Care Organizations, population health management, providers, insurers and home healthcare. Strategic partnerships include: Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (integration and co-sell), 2nd largest PERS company (co-sell), AMR Ambulance / BCBS, White Plains Hospital, a $47B Population Health company, and Avixena Decision Support solutions. Life365 is a participant in the Mayo Clinic / Arizona State Univ. accelerator, as well as Microsoft for Startups and Plug & Play. Life365 is a 2021 Edison Award recipient for COVID-19 solutions, and recently named an AVIA 2022 Top 50 Remote Monitoring Companies. Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) is integrated to 300+ health systems and hospitals, with a key initiative to support scaling healthcare services to consumers at home. Life365 is the only RPM company integrated to the MC4H platform and listed in the Microsoft Marketplace, which allows Life365 to sell through 2000+ Microsoft healthcare account reps, who account for roughly $100B of Microsoft sales each year in contracted health systems and hospitals. Life365 integrates to over 432 OEM medical devices and will continue to add new solutions and services to the platform, connected to MC4H, as needed or available. Microsoft is currently coselling with Life365 at major health systems and hospitals. Typically, a contract and integration with individual hospitals can take 6-12 months per installation. By contrast, with Life365’s integration to MC4H and leveraging Microsoft’s contract with 300+ health systems / hospitals, the timeline is potentially reduced to a few weeks. Life365 has been issued 8 US patents with 10 pending applications. We have bundled more than 40 US and foreign patents for AI Driven Wearables, Triage, Micro Dispensing and more, to support the next generation of Virtual Care.

Quidient makes virtualization from images accurate, affordable, and automatic using a pioneering new method called Generalized Scene Reconstruction (GSR). The platform is designed to run on ubiquitous devices like smartphones and tablets. Quidient Reality engines are actually five-dimensional (5D) in that they record the three linear dimensions of matter (3D) concurrent with two directional dimensions of light (2D). This revolutionary approach enables devices like smartphones to create complete, visually accurate models of any scene or object, including those that are shiny and transparent. Transformational applications that have been “around the corner” for years like digital content creation, automated visual inspection, and augmented reality (AR), will be enabled by GSR. As the disruptive technology becomes widely deployed, billions in economic value will be released in markets including entertainment, mobile, consumer products, insurance, defense, automotive, healthcare, construction, and real estate. For you technophiles: convergent technologies used in Quidient’s engines include light field physics, spatially sorted 5D databases, and imaging polarimetry. Polarimetric cameras, optionally used with Quidient Reality engines, can “see” the shape of the world from single images. AI/ML can be remarkably enhanced when it is based on 5D data. Quidient is a 3D imaging technology firm led by a world-class team of scientists, developers, and entrepreneurs who have built some of the most advanced 3D imaging systems in the world.

These treatments cause complications. Mechanically ventilated patients develop increased complications and frequent long-term damage to the respiratory system. If the development of respiratory failure is detected early, intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation may be prevented. And hence achieve savings in suffering and expenses.  Currently, there are no early warning for respiratory failure solutions for the patient except in the ICU. The standard of care is detecting only the changes in the CO2 and O2 saturation in the blood; in-failure already conditions. ATLASense has developed a breakthrough solution for remotely managing respiratory deterioration of hospitalized patients and at home. ATLASense is the only one in the world that develops already-proven solutions to provide healthcare providers with the earliest possible prediction of respiratory failure allowing effective preventive care!   We are the only one in the world developing a game-changing product for the hospital at-home market, providing an early warning system for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases with one small chest-warn wireless PolyMonitor. Enable healthcare providers to save 77% of the care costs or over $300 per day per patient. 1 Billion people's target market may get this subscription service for less the $5 a day per patient. Winner of the 2020 Henry Ford Health System global monitoring competition, ATLASense developed the REPHAEL platform, patented AI-based remote Health near real-time monitoring, empowering healthcare providers' teams to: 1. Prevent premature deaths 2. Reduce treatments costs 3. Improve patients' quality of life 4. Have a profit engine The REPHAEL platform is the only RPM system that enables the earliest possible prediction of: • Heart failure • Respiratory failure • Early signs of Sepsis. All by a single chest-worn PolyMonitor reusable device.",https://www.facebook.com/ATLASense/,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Middle East",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Health Care, Information Technology",5,"Dan Atlas, Joshua Rothfarb, Ori Elyada, Shimon Yisraelian, Tal Or",11-50,4,Seed,2022-11-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,876000,USD,876000,7756000,USD,7756000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,

We are crypto financial advisors who aim to bridge the gap between traditional and crypto investing. Making crypto investing transparent, fearless, and accessible are the three pillars of our mission. Transparent: Our educational approach aims to make cryptocurrency more transparent to help people who want guidance and advice to start investing in cryptocurrency. We want you to understand what we invest in, why we invest in it, and, if interested, learn as you go. Fearless: With CryptoSimple, you can feel confident that your money is safe and secure, as we are among the first AMF-registered companies in Europe. We provide portfolio and risk-adjusted portfolio generation technology to meet the needs of any investor. Accessible: If you want to get started, you don't need a crypto wallet, and we offer a low transparent management fee (no gas fees, no deposit or withdrawal fees, no hidden fees whatsoever). We build solutions across DeFi's (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem, which allows our users to earn interest in the same way traditional investing does, but with DeFi, your interest is compounded and you earn round the clock. We will be introducing a robo-advisor solution that will allow you to invest in a diversified crypto portfolio in accordance with your financial goals and risk tolerance. By combining blockchain technology with financial technology, our portfolios cater to every risk level, whether you are a conservative or aggressive investor. Our conservative portfolio, for example, consists of 90% stable coins, while offering 5% to 20% returns and have minimal exposure to volatile coins. Our waitlist is now open.

With a pilot scale dairy situated on 800 hectares, Good Earth Dairy has spent over $4.5m in 4 years developing its technology to enable to bring prices below $3.5/L (pre-genetic yield improvements). The milk is currently sold at an average $18/L throughout Australia with 300g tins of powder selling for over AUD$100 in China (closer to AUD$150). The IP created ranges across the entire value chain from capture, selection all the way to product development. The IP also includes the capability to rapidly and efficiently scale to more than 3 million litres per annum per designed module. As camel milk does not contain the key dairy allergen unlike any other animal milk, has a lower casein count to cow & goat milk, having a more digestible casein as well as having the smallest fat cells (again more digestible); it creates a premium infant formula product. This will gain significant market penetration in the $56 Billion global market via the premium position but also for the +10% of infants that are allergic to traditional dairy. Good Earth Dairy intends not only to have their own brands of infant formula, but also be the supplier of powder to the other major players. Currently all produced milk from our pilot plant is selling out via stockists throughout Perth (WA, Australia) without any marketing.
