Our unwavering commitment is to prioritize the safety of all parties engaged in this endeavor. Our ultimate aim is to seamlessly incorporate drones into the global airspace, ensuring their seamless integration into our daily routines. This fundamental aspiration is the driving force behind the establishment of Unifly. Two air traffic controllers harbored a common vision: they observed an increasing presence of drones in the airspace, yet they lacked the means to effectively manage or visualize these unmanned aircraft. The questions arose: How can you spot the drone, and where is its operator? How do you establish a connection with them? This vision led to the birth of Unifly, a collective of aerospace experts who embarked on a mission to create a platform facilitating the secure integration of drones into the airspace. Initially born as a spin-off from VITO, the Flemish institute for technological research, Unifly has since blossomed into the industry's leading innovator in unmanned traffic management technology, earning multiple awards along the way. - Safety is paramount - Research indicates that the drone industry holds the potential for a market valuation of $130 billion. Drones possess the capacity to revolutionize our everyday experiences, yet there exists a critical caveat. Safety stands as an utmost priority and, consequently, emerges as our most pressing concern. Both national aviation authorities and private enterprises confront a paramount inquiry: ""How can we guarantee the vigilant oversight of both recreational and commercial drone activities to ensure security?"" - Innovation is key - Presently, we find ourselves presented with an extraordinary prospect to influence the airspace of the future. We hold a firm conviction that cooperation and transparency stand as indispensable elements in realizing this vision. This is precisely why Unifly engages in partnerships with numerous research entities and businesses, both within Belgium and on the global stage. Unifly's groundbreaking technology empowers governing bodies, corporations, and vital infrastructure operators to oversee the seamless integration of drones. Our open platform harmonizes the interests of all stakeholders, establishing an air traffic management system for drones that enhances visibility and averts potential collisions.",https://www.facebook.com/uniflynv,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Hardware, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Software",4,"Andres Van Swalm, Hans Schrauwen, Jürgen Verstaen, Koen Meuleman",11-50,4,M&A,2022-05-04,10000000,EUR,10620942,Venture - Series Unknown,10000000,EUR,10620942,Venture - Series Unknown,33200000,EUR,36471944,33200000,EUR,36471944,"Terra Drone, PMV, SFPI-FPIM, Qbic Fund, DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung",3,6,,Was Acquired,2023-08-22,day,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,-38.65%,37,,,12,2,3,Controlling,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,1603692,USD,1603692

Clean.Tech was founded in 2017 by Robbie Lemos and Petr Brazdil, each having managed large technology teams at leading solar companies. The founders helped pioneer augmented reality-based solar automation within the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s incubator program. Their startup, Sunlayar, was later acquired by Sunnova. They believe that solar is currently a failed product. This is because, despite the high demand and associated cost savings of solar, total market penetration remains below 5%.  Clean.Tech believes a software-centered, “asset-light” business model that is focused on continuous design and process improvement will allow solar to finally achieve large-scale adoption. Clean.Tech uses A.I. and tools such as augmented reality to help buyers visualize solar systems on their roofs and make real-time adjustments to clearly understand the costs and benefits of going solar, which facilitates quick sales cycles. Residential buyers can also apply for 0% down, long-term financing from third-party lenders through Clean.Tech’s app usually within the same sales session as choosing a solar system. These innovations help buyers feel in control of their customer journey and reduce the friction that is typically associated with purchasing a solar system.  Similar to Uber, Clean.Tech uses software to bring together independent sales agents and certified, third-party installers into a process that is standardized with strong quality controls. This marketplace model allows Clean.Tech to keep fixed costs low, which in turn leads to high scalability and improved pricing for consumers. Unlike Uber, Clean.Tech does not need to subsidize the marketplace as there are already large pools of independent salespeople and installers who need work.   Clean.Tech uses its growing purchasing power to routinely negotiate better terms with its third-party partners and, in turn, offer better pricing to buyers of solar systems, further improving the buying experience versus competitors. Also, Clean.Tech manages a global workforce with compensation tied to revenue goals, which has kept costs relatively low and helps drive profitability.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Information Technology, Natural Resources, Software, Sustainability",1,Robbie Lemos,11-50,1,Seed,2020-03-06,2000000,USD,2000000,Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,2000000,USD,2000000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,6,,,,,,,,,

We use millions of high-quality music samples to generate and deliver exclusive, royalty-free music using the power of AI. With a near-endless music library featuring more than 100 musical categories, users can search by genre, mood and activity to find the perfect song for their project. Mubert, a platform trusted by thousands of content creators and companies like Banuba, BetterMe, Sensorium, Adidas, InsightTimer, Restream, MacPaw and Crello, can help you find the music you need. Democratization of Creator Economy Our one-of-a-kind creator-centric platform utilizes AI to generate unlimited royalty-free music. Users can generate tracks on the go or search through a massive database of pre-made tracks to create highly personalized content. With a variety of license types, dynamic presets for streaming and over 1 million samples from more than 4,000 musicians, it is one of the most powerful and versatile music licensing platforms around. Stand Out From The Crowd – Music For Content Creators Content creators often struggle with sifting through thousands of stock audio tracks in search of the “perfect soundtrack.” Unfortunately, stock music never quite fits. Using YouTube tune library can be just as fruitless for the unique content creator, as many of these tracks have been used by millions of creators before. With Mubert, content creators gain access to real-time generative music and pre-made tracks, which they may Render with the genre, mood and length, allowing for more customization than ever before. The platform has more than 100 genres and a large selection of attributes, such as mood, tempo and genre, to help creators find the right music for their project fast. App creators enjoy the adaptive nature of Mubert’s music, which helps increase the in-app and in-game user experience. From casual Twitch and Youtube Streamers to app-building gurus, the platform provides unique, custom-made music with a single subscription. Music Without Strikes or Copyright Infringements Fears of copyright/DMCA claims and strikes can hinder a content creator’s ability to work freely. One mistake and hours of work could be tossed down the drain due to unexpected or unpredictable platform algorithms. People often end up dealing with stock websites that don’t have the correct license, websites with inaccurate license descriptions, licenses that don’t cover the necessary content, or licenses that aren’t available in all countries. When content creators use Mubert, they never have to worry about music licensing or confusing royalty agreements. The beauty of Mubert is that all of the music on our platform is royalty-free and available for use worldwide. Our licenses and sub-licenses are 100% DMCA-friendly and compatible with a number of platforms, i.e., YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and more. Plus, when you license music through Mubert, you get support from licensing professionals who can help you with any questions you might have! Empowering Artists With nominal commissions, hungry publishing companies and an unstable industry, artists often find it difficult to diversify their income. Here at Mubert, we understand the importance of artists, musicians and producers, which is why we collaborate with them using unique frameworks so that they can monetize their music. When artists work with Mubert, they receive a platform on which they can express themselves and earn real money on their work. When a content creator licenses music from Mubert, they are licensing high-quality, pro-level audio material made with the involvement of independent music producers.

AI-powered menswear rental subscription service in the U.S.,"24,948",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://taelor.style/,https://twitter.com/TaelorStyle,https://www.linkedin.com/company/69612960,"Taelor is a Silicon Valley-based fashion industry start-up founded by Anya Cheng, ex Facebook and Target Lead who led teams to build Facebook Shopping and Target eCommerce and a current Northwestern University faculty member.  Taelor is a revolutionary new way for men to rent clothes, allowing them to look and feel great every day while also reducing their carbon footprint. The service uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence and personal stylists to select clothes for men based on their sizes and personal preferences. The clothes are shipped directly to customers, who can either wear them for two weeks and return them or purchase the clothes for up to 70% off the regular retail price. Customers then receive another box of clothes. “Our goal is to provide individuals with stylish, everyday menswear. We believe that every day is an opportunity to look good and feel confident,” said Cheng, a former digital product lead at Facebook, eBay and Target. “And when you rent clothes instead of buying them, you not only save the time and energy of having to search and shop for clothes, but you also help the environment, too, instead of purchasing clothes that will eventually end up in a landfill.” Cheng has a strong background in both the digital and retail space. A TEDx Talk speaker and best-selling book author, Cheng spent 15 years leading digital innovation teams at Facebook, eBay, Target, McDonald’s and Sears before launching Taelor. Cheng said she originally got the idea to start a clothing rental subscription service for men after becoming a huge fan of other clothing rental subscription services herself. “I became such a fan of renting clothes that I haven’t purchased any clothes for myself except for underwear for the past five years,” Cheng says. “But I realized that none of the clothing rental services really served menswear nor focuses on helping people to achieve career or personal goals in their everyday life, and I thought, men should be able to enjoy this service too so they can feel ready and confident for their day.”  The popularity of sustainability practices, minimalism, and no-ownership trends have caused the clothing rental business model to explode in recent years, with some analysts projecting that the Circular Fashion industry, which includes rental and resale, could earn as much as $66 billion by 2024 in the U.S. alone. Taelor gives customers the option to choose between two different subscription packages. The first option is a flat, monthly fee, where customers get two boxes per month, which include four shirts per box. The second option is for customers to pay a one-time fee, where customers receive three boxes in total, with four shirts per box. Both options include complimentary personalized styling, dry cleaning, and shipping both ways — making the process of renting and returning clothing easy and effortless. It’s a service that is a perfect solution for busy individuals who don’t want to spend time shopping or picking out their clothes. “I want to look good, but I don't really want to spend time shopping,” says Danny Ma, one of Taelor’s first customers. “I considered clothing subscription boxes for years, but I didn’t want to commit to buying something from each box. After using Taelor, I am much more confident!”  For more information about Taelor, please visit https://taelor.style.

We design extra modules and attachments to help our users regain employment, and sell them upgrades and replacements over time.

SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable. Through our network, anyone can verify identities quickly and securely with the ability for organisations checking the data to be compensated for their work.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Payments, Privacy and Security, Software",2,"Ankur Banerjee, Fraser Edwards",11-50,2,Seed,2021-09-22,2600000,USD,2600000,Seed,2600000,USD,2600000,Seed,3300000,USD,3300000,3300000,USD,3300000,"Outlier Ventures, Double Peak Group, SkyVision Capital, Bixin Ventures, Exnetwork Capital",2,7,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49.85%,30,,,,,,,,,,
