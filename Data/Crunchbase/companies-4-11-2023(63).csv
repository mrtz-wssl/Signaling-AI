We completed a multi-site clinical study in 2018 among pediatric cancer patients and showed that Triumf digital health intervention has a positive effect on players emotional state and health related quality of life. We showed that the total acceptability percentage of the game was 86%. Importantly, 100% answered that the game was easy to use and the content and information was useful and trustworthy. Furthermore, 100% would recommend the game to a friend. By comparing pre-study and post-study mean scores of mental wellbeing and quality of life, we found improvements in mental health and health related quality of life.

Their automated characterization pipeline gathers the oft-overlooked data that highlights unleveraged bacteria that meet functional industrial criteria. That is, they rapidly find the bacteria with naturally unfussy eating habits and evolution-honed metabolisms that have the potential to convert unrefined biomasses into commodity chemicals at vastly improved efficiencies compared to extant fermentation processes. They select from these functionally de-risked bacteria those which can be directly genetically modified to improve their cost profiles — even if they have never been engineered before. The data from our unique characterization pipeline informs the minimally precise genetic modifications necessary to increase pliability and yield, eliminate nutritional additives, maximize feedstock utilization, and improve contamination tolerance & phage resistance. MicroByre gives biomass conversion a truly competitive edge against petrochemical synthesis. 				 MicroByre’s platform bridges the gap between the promising and the profitable in synthetic biology and bioengineering.

But cash management is a huge problem for the entire industry. If you work at a retail bank, you already know how expensive it is to install an ATM and also to operate it. Most major retail banks globally spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to distribute cash to their consumers. But it's not just a problem for the retail banks. Retailers struggle as well. When they get paid in cash, they need to collect, can't reconcile, and finally bring the cash back to the bank anyway. Every single step costs them time and money. And if you look at the consumers, they often struggle as well to find an ATM, how much do I have to pay to withdraw cash? I recently read an article it talked about Egypt; some consumers travel seven kilometers to access cash and find the nearest ATM. That's insane. That's exactly where we come in, what Uber did to the taxi industry, Airbnb, to the hotel industry. We are doing it for the ATM industry. We're democratizing the cash distribution process so that a significant portion of the value chain can be eliminated. Anybody can download a mobile app and act as a virtual ATM. We have created a location-based matchmaking platform that connects those who want to withdraw cash in real-time with those who want to deposit cash, which typically could be a local shop owner, like a bakery or pizzeria or a bar or restaurant. This way, the shop owner gets rid of cash and earns a commission. It also attracts additional foot traffic to the store. You, as a consumer, can now withdraw cash at the click of a button whenever you are globally, and finally, banks can save up to 50 percent of their operating costs by simply switching over from a physical ATM to a virtual ATM solution that we provide. How does it work? It's simple, just download an app, connect with your bank account, and request how much you want to withdraw. Let's say you want to withdraw one hundred dollars. It does a geolocation-based search around you to find a spot, basically, a retailer with that hundred dollars for you to go and pick it up. You walk in, show a QR Code, scan the barcode, and hand out the cash to you as if you had just transacted at an ATM. QWQ is a location-based matchmaking platform that connects those who want to withdraw cash with those who want to deposit cash – typically a local shop owner. It builds a community around local businesses and helps them generate physical leads. - Smart algorithm and an amazing user experience  QWQ Value Proposition summary:  Local shops will not only have less cash to manage at the end of the day but also earn a commission & attract new customers by offering a new service and having access to an additional marketing channel -Leads and a new revenue stream. Individuals can avoid an extra trip to the ATM and withdraw money at the click of a button – wherever they are: in a restaurant, a cafe, their favorite local shop,.... - User Convenience. banks and E-wallets can reduce ATM operation costs & complement their ATM network – or even enter new markets without investing significant capital. On top of that, they can leverage a new revenue channel and get closer to their customers. - Scale and expansion",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Middle East",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Lending and Investments",1,Amr Barakat,1-10,1,Seed,2020-06-01,300000,USD,300000,Pre-Seed,300000,USD,300000,Pre-Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,

Buying and investing in real estate is incredibly challenging for seasoned investors, and it's almost impossible for retail investors.  By leveraging blockchain technologies, we can create a unique and revolutionary investment vehicle; called a Thread. Threads indirectly own and manage real estate, governed in the real world by a legal representative but directed on the blockchain by the collective voting power of investors. By incorporating this structure, Threads aren't beholden to the same restrictions and limitations imposed by regulatory bodies, making Fractional Finance free of any legal liability over the creation and governance of these entities. Because of this, we have the power to scale where others simply cannot. Fractional Finance generates revenue on creating these ""Threads"" via a tokenization process, which will charge between a ****fee which will cover all operational and legal costs, along with small ****reoccurring fees to cover property management, taxes, and property insurance, which can be opt-outed from. We don't charge any individual for either of our fees, but rather the collective pool of investors and property listers involved in a particular Thread. This ""distribution of pain"" can allow us to charge higher rates without negatively affecting any particular investor or user and make it easier to persuade property sellers to tokenize and sell on the Frabric Network. As the only decentralized fractional real estate platform; we win via economies of scale and global reach; we don't need to onboard each property ourselves, and to scout the best deals - we provide great referral incentives which will drive existing investors/sellers onto our platform via network effects which will enable us to grow infinitely faster than our competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Other, Real Estate",1,James Sutton,1-10,3,Seed,2022-06-20,480000,USD,480000,Pre-Seed,480000,USD,480000,Pre-Seed,480000,USD,480000,505000,USD,505000,"Blockchain Founders Fund, SMU Entrepreneurship Centre",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,

Zarttech can also help get your IT project done quickly and efficiently while making a social impact individually and collectively. We provide you with the best hand-picked Senior IT Experts within 24 hours if needed. Our focus is on two main services: Outstaffing and Outsourcing. Outstaffing: We provide IT Experts to join your team on a fully remote, hybrid-remote, or onsite basis. They will work under your supervision. Zarttech employs all IT Experts, and after a duration of time of staffing through Zarttech, businesses can directly hire such talent or team when trust is built. As a result, our team will become part of your team. Outsourcing: You provide us with your project. Our expert(s) realise the solution using the highest quality agile practices. We also offer outsourcing services for custom software development projects where the Senior Experts are working, employed, and led by Zarttech. Our Foundation At Zarttech, we always pay it forward.

Our solution redefines the healthcare experience of patients, payors, and providers by connecting all participants in the healthcare decision to create bundled pricing in real time, simplify scheduling, secure payor approval, and guarantee immediate cash payment™. Savvos eliminates the need for health plans to develop networks or direct contracts for elective outpatient care by making immediate cash payment the future of mainstream healthcare.  Savvos members know the cost when scheduling care, and providers are paid immediately; this unique combination reduces medical costs up to 90% compared to traditional networks or legacy billing practices.  The implementation of immediate cash payment solutions within health plans has resulted in a drastic cost reduction compared to billed charges, contracted rates, direct contracts, and allowable amounts for elective outpatient care.   The examples below are pulled from actual procedure requests within the Savvos system: Example 1:  Inguinal Hernia Repair	CPT Code 49505	Zip Code 46123 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Billed Charge for Facility Only: $19,739 Allowed Charge for Facility: $13,560 Allowed Charge for Surgeon: $2,200 (estimated cost) Allowed Charge for Anesthesia:  $800 (estimated cost) Total Allowed Charge without Savvos: $16,560 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $8,330 Result: 49.7% reduction in costs through Savvos Example 2:  Tympanostomy 		CPT Code 69436	Zip Code 23502	 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Allowed Charge for Bundled Price: $11,810 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $2,200 Result: 81.4% reduction in costs through Savvos Example 3:  Cervical Disc Rep	CPT Code 22856	Zip Code 80233 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Billed Charge for Facility & Anesthesia: $85,000 Allowed Charge for Facility & Anesthesia: $34,450 Allowed Charge for Surgeon: $4,068 Total Allowed Charge without Savvos: $38,518 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $12,500 Result: 67.55% reduction in costs through Savvos Example 4:  Total Lap Hysterectomy	CPT Code 58570	Zip Code 92861 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Allowed Charge for Facility: $27,325 Allowed Charge for Surgeon: $4,200 Allowed Charge for Anesthesia:  $1,108 Total Allowed Charge without Savvos: $32,633 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $7,895 Result: 76% reduction in costs through Savvos The movement towards price transparency requires more than a casual listing of chargemaster prices or regional averages.  Savvos connects patients with actual prices from facilities located in the patient’s local market, resulting in dramatic cost savings to the health plan.  Most patients are provided with generous financial incentives to engage with affordable providers through Savvos, including waiving the deductible or waiving all out-of-pocket costs.  The results of implementing Savvos are powerful: 1.	Enhanced member experience through Savvos messaging center that connects all parties involved in the decision-making process for a specific procedure 2.	Dramatic cost reductions for health plans 3.	Improved member benefits through generous incentives such as deductible waivers 4.
