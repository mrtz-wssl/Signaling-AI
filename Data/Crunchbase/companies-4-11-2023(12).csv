Oculii's AI software amplifies the resolution of any radar platform, enabling high performance perception for the next generation of autonomous systems. Traditional phased array radars have been used for decades and follow a strict size for performance tradeoff - the larger the sensor aperture, the higher the angular resolution. Oculii’s Virtual Aperture Imaging radar technology fundamentally breaks this tradeoff - enabling its sensors to trade increased compute/processing for angular resolution enhancement with the same physical aperture. Leveraging this technique enables Oculii sensors to extract unprecedented accuracy, range, and 4D positioning information from commodity off the shelf low-cost radar elements, bringing high resolution radar imaging to the next frontier.

The goal of our AI Squared technology is to level this playing field by providing AI integration technologies that would increase AI adoption and enable access to AI for anyone. This is our story. Dr. Benjamin Harvey was the Chief of Operations Data Science at NSA where he experienced challenges first-hand associated with the inability to adopt AI,  provide equitable access to AI, and unlock the value of AI for intelligence analysts and the military warfighter.  His inspiration came from his two brothers who were Army officers recently deployed to the Middle East (Kuwait, Iraq and Qatar) and SW Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan) who both relied on intelligence to achieve mission. He began a journey and developed a solution to solve these inequities that simplifies and accelerates AI integration into applications ultimately protecting lives of Americans and military warfighters in similar situations as his brothers.   Our vision is to build the world’s most powerful model integration framework and AI integration software which enables any application to become AI-powered. For the first time ever data scientists can describe their models using our model integration framework and our AI integration software will overlay intelligence from inference results directly into a pre-existing web application.

Branded entertainment in movies & TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models. Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business.
