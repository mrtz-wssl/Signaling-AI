ChickenBoy is a disruptive new technology that balances animal welfare with productivity by using machine learning, pattern recognition and a combination of sensors to provide optimal decision support to farmers and other users. It represents an intelligent, robotic broiler surveillance solution that measures vital parameters at the level of chickens for observation and detection of health and welfare issues (body temperature, gastro-intestinal diseases, healthy feeding, leg disorders, etc.). It is an autonomously moving smart observation platform with on-board capability for vision (visible and thermal), sound and measurement of ambient conditions.

Caplena.com uses Augmented Intelligence to drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to analyze large amounts of free text from reviews or responses to open-ended questions. It all began when one of the co- founders, Maurice, won the prestigious SemEval competition for his Master Thesis. He began to explore ideas in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field with his colleague Pascal, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in the field of Natural Language and Computer Vision. They soon realized a gap in the industry when Link and Success Drivers - two Market Research firms - inquired if the same technology could help them with open-ended survey coding. As it turned out, almost all firms that handle customer feedback face the same issue: too many open ends and not enough time to accurately analyze them all. Four months later, Pascal and Maurice had completed the first prototype - and things began to take off quickly. Since its inception in the spring of 2017, Caplena has doubled the number of text responses it processes every six months, with over 50M verbatims processed to date. Today Caplena serves companies in more than 15 countries.  From rapidly growing start-ups like Joyn to Fortune 500 companies like eBay & DHL - we have managed to achieve unparalleled customer loyalty.

Nanomnia aims to identify precision biotechnologies in agriculture for a better pest management, combining innovative methods with environmental protection. Nanomnia produces organic, biodegradable and biocompatible nanoparticles, for encapsulation of active compounds, such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, to be selectively vehicled in plants. Nanoparticles increase the efficiency of crop treatments, further reducing their volatilization and decreasing toxicity and environmental contamination in crops. Nanoparticles are developed by Nanomnia with different biodegradable and biocompatible polymers that do not cause any type of environmental contamination, and are stable during their storage. Thus agri-nanotechnology holds the promise of controlled release of agrochemicals and site targeted delivery of various macromolecules needed for improved plant resistance to disease, efﬁcient nutrient utilization and enhanced plant growth.

Dry eye is the inability of the tear film and lids to protect the surface of the eye, resulting in itching, burning, and pain. With a dozen or more underlying causes, dry eye is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat, and if left untreated, it can lead to permanent corneal damage. Patients with even moderate dry eye can suffer from debilitating symptoms that lead to a drastically reduced quality of life. Current treatment options are limited, and most patients rely on over-the-counter eye drops for temporary relief. But because they neither treat the root cause nor appropriately address the symptoms, current products on the market fail to provide adequate relief and must be reapplied as often as 6-12 times every day. By pairing proven technologies with pioneering research, EternaTear™ is developing a product that is closest to natural tears.

These provide guaranteed, lucrative fixed payments per month per patient - a valuable source of guaranteed patient volume in new clinics.   • Outcomes driven: Their machine learning relapse prediction tool and point of service decision support tool will enable quality consistent care across diffuse clinic locations while also identifying risks of relapse for each patient and adjusted plans of care at each patient visit to reduce relapses and increase successful outcomes of treatment.

The Mitral Butterfly® implant is deployed by means of a catheter (thin tube) through the vascular system onto the beating heart, thereby eliminating the need for open-heart surgery. The treatment can reduce costs due to shortened hospitalization times and may be available to non-option patients, along with younger, healthier patients.

What's the problem we are solving? First: most customer interactions AREN'T in the CRM. They're in phone/video conversations. Second: most revenue teams don't record their conversations. When they record, they sit on 1000's of call recordings and listen to less than 1%. As a consequence, it's hard to achieve scalable and consistent growth. That's why we built Callrox. We automatically capture calls and video conferences, linked with CRM data. With a proprietary speech-to-text technology we analyze these conversations to discover replicable insights. As a result, we enable a data-driven coaching process that increases conversion rate and ACV, shorten sales cycles, reduces ramp up time and helps the revenue team to deliver a better customer experience and satisfaction. The main benefits we generate for our customers are: 1. Identify best practices of top performers 2. Create training material for new hires 3. Identify market and competitive trends 4. Ensure the strategy is being executed by the frontline team 5. Save manager's time listening to calls 6. Increase engagement with customers (share recording) 7. Increase the quality of conversations in real-time (keep the focus on the customer), letting AEs and CSMs know which talking points need to be addressed. 8. Increase productivity of revenue teams with summaries and real-time data capture - AI understands and captures answers automatically and imports it all to CRM. 9. Put the follow-up process on autopilot - generate a compelling follow-up email for every call to drive engagement faster and close more deals. 10.
