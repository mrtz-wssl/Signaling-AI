The platform's goal is to become the DeFi Execution Management System for translating strategy into results across different blockchain networks. Dexible uniquely focuses on dex markets and supports fully non-custodial trading, while concealing the trader's intent for future swaps. The platform gives users core atomic functionality out-of-the-box that vastly improves overall performance for portfolio managers who want to deploy capital strategically and efficiently. No subscription or registration is required to get started. If funds are held in MPC wallets like Fireblocks or Qredo, traders simply connect to the platform via WalletConnect or Metamask. Traders rely on Dexible full life cycle trade support for their dex swaps and accounting management. Dexible's 7 order types draw inspiration from those offered in traditional finance including TWAP/DCA, Stop Limit, Stop Loss, Take Profit, and Limit Orders. The Dexible aggregator pulls liquidity from 57 AMMs to make swaps possible and uses a smart order router to determine the best pricing across 5 different networks. Automated trading leads to far superior outcomes for strategies trading in long-tail assets. Some unique use cases the platform introduces include rug pull protection, buying dips in prices, price bounded Dollar Cost Averaging, minimizing transaction fees, preserving profits, and illiquid market swaps. The Dexible team repurposed infrastructure from a signals composition engine designed for Ethereum devs into automated trading after the CDL accelerator in the summer of 2020. Today, Dexible's infrastructure evaluates multichain market conditions 24/7. The platform automatically evaluates parent orders and splits up the total input to reduce total swap slippage by up to 30%. Orders have custom algorithms based on trader’s criteria boiled down to True-False policies. Traders get detailed pre-trade estimates and post-trade analytics to improve decision-making.",,"West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Payments, Software",3,"Michael Coon, Mike Powers, Mitchell Opatowsky",1-10,2,Seed,2021-01-20,1500000,USD,1500000,Pre-Seed,1500000,USD,1500000,Pre-Seed,1500000,USD,1500000,1500000,USD,1500000,Creative Destruction Lab (CDL),1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,

Unima is solving is the centralization of lab testing, which limits the access to a timely diagnostic for billions. Current technology for diagnostics is very precise and can detect almost any disease known, but the problem is these require labs with expensive equipment and specialized technicians making lab testing impossible to scale up to provide universal and timely access to diagnostics. To solve this problem Unima developed Find, a rapid testing technology platform for real time diagnostics which allows anyone to diagnose a disease directly where it is needed, without using lab equipment, with results in 15 minutes or less and at a very low cost. With Find anyone can have access to a timely diagnostic even in the most remote areas of the world. The Find platform uses shark antibodies modified with genetic engineering to detect disease biomarkers in blood, saliva, urine or water samples. These shark antibodies are used in microfluidic cards and generate a visual reactions when in contact with specific biomarkers of the disease to be tested. Then to evaluate the result of the test, a picture of the testing card is taken with the proprietary Xplora smartphone app which runs image analysis process and neural network algorithms to generate an inmediate result. Then this result,along with contextual information like geolocation, date and time, is sent to a cloud server where it can be used for real time disease tracking.",,Latin America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,"Alejandro Nuno, Jose Luis Nuno, Laura Mendoza, Rodrigo Nuno",11-50,7,Seed,2021-10-01,33300,USD,33300,Angel,33300,USD,33300,Angel,1966300,USD,1966300,2016300,USD,2016300,"MassChallenge, Y Combinator, Social Capital, Avalancha Ventures, Paul Buchheit",4,20,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,4,,,8,,,,,,,

Using small arrays of speakers and advanced head tracking technologies, immersive 3D Sound will no longer require headphones or speakers located all around a room. We will deliver an unrivalled, authentic and natural audio experience for consumers of immersive Gaming, VR and Movie audio. The AudioScenic system allows a user to experience sounds in a way which is far superior to a conventional loudspeaker system. In a traditional loudspeaker set-up, sound radiates out from the speaker before bouncing off the walls and other objects in the room prior to reaching the ear. What you hear is a mix of the original and reflected sound creating, at best, a distorted ""3D"" effect. In contrast, AudioScenic delivers controlled and independent sound beams direct to the left and right ears. In this way we can create ""virtual headphones"" and deliver spatial audio which simulates sounds positioned in 3D space all around the listener. In addition, our proprietary head tracking technology enables the independent beams of sound to follow the ears of a listener, delivering perfect 3D Sound no matter what position they occupy or whether they move either whilst playing a computer game or watching a movie. Thanks to AudioScenic's technology the ""sweet-spot"" concept belongs to the past. AudioScenic offers solutions for a range of different platforms and a variety of market applications. Our designs use expandable loudspeakers arrays with varying numbers of drivers to create precisely controlled sound beams. AudioScenic works hand-in-hand with our partners and customers to provide the detailed acoustic design support required to implement different products including Home Cinema, Gaming, Simulation, VR and public space audio systems. The AudioScenic Virtua 3D Engine has been ported to leading signal processing platforms.

Loop Genomics technology transforms short-read DNA sequencers into high-throughput, long-read, single-molecule DNA sequencing machines. Loop Genomics long-read DNA sequencing technology provides phased sequencing solutions across a diverse repertoire of research and clinical applications. Sequencing of partial rRNA gene sequences results in reduced phylogenetic resolution. Full-length, high-throughput, phased sequencing that covers all 16S variable regions is becoming the gold standard for profiling the microbiome. Achieve the highest resolution microbial community profiling with long-read, next-generation sequencing of the microbiome. Characterizing polymorphisms in HLA genes inside and outside of the protein-coding regions is important for organ transplantation compatibility testing and for strengthening causality association studies.  The length of homologous sequences between HLA alleles extends beyond the capabilities of short-read sequencing platforms, resulting in diploid ambiguities and a reliance on imputation.  Sequence full-length HLA DNA and/or RNA with phased, high throughput, long-read sequencing that resolves allelic discrimination and diploid ambiguity. Viral genetic variability is a major determinant of viral drug resistance and viral vaccine efficacy.  Accurately mapping viral genetic variability is a critical step in choosing the optimal course of therapy and developing efficacious vaccines.  Key mutations are typically located throughout long stretches of viral genomes, making the retrieval of critical phased data challenging using short-read sequencing technology.

Michael remains on the advisory board of Solaris and will help advise the company with future mergers and acquisitions. He continues to build much needed infrastructure in emerging states in the USA. Michael Sassano broke ground on what would become Solaris Farms in 2016 after traveling around the world touring different types of agricultural greenhouses and observing the various technologies used to produce high-quality yields in harsh climates. From the get-go, he envisioned building a major cultivation company in Nevada’s business-friendly environment which he’d either sell or expand to maximum government approved canopy.  Solaris has a rotation of 7,000 plants and bi-monthly 1000 plant harvests which are sold at every major dispensary in Las Vegas and throughout Nevada. Michael built Solaris Farms into a Las Vegas icon but also gathered global recognition which he plans to continue expanding. The grow exists on a portion of the land which is state-approved for cultivation space of over 300,000 sq ft.
