The vehicles we drive today are extremely harmful to our planet and even our health, with vehicle emissions causing more premature deaths than car accidents. These numbers are even more extreme in cities, which host 54% of the world’s population, a number that continues to grow. People in cities have become accustomed to the toxic smell, but these emissions are completely unnecessary and cause critical problems that must be addressed, such as a recent study that showed a direct link between emissions and clinical mental health problems in children. This is especially troubling when you consider that only 2-3% of the energy burned in cars today actually moves its passengers. The average vehicle weight is 1.8 tonnes, while the average occupancy per vehicle trip is only 1.2 people, and 80% of these vehicle trips are less than 25km.

The inspirational success story of the empire redirects to Ashini Gogoi, an ex-Meta employee, who haphazardly started it as a lifestyle community on Instagram in January 2021 as per an investigation by CNN—Forbes declared that he is a young yet enigmatic self-made CEO. Following his vision in August 2020, Ashini managed to take a loan capital of US$40,000 from his friends and family, his company started making headlines in major publications for the first time in November 2022, when the company signed a contract with the American rapper, Wiz Khalifa. The company is listed as a high-profile organization on Crunchbase and is actively offering its services in Tier 1 countries as of 2023—a statistical analysis showed that 87% of its customer base is women from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy. The company's website gets active during major festivals only and consumers can purchase for a limited duration of seven days, hence selling out very quickly—their most affordable models that hold their value start between $850 and $1,200. ""ALPHS Inc. is one of the most secretive young companies in corporate history next to the giant Rolex,"" says the American business newspaper, The Wall Street Journal. Reports suggest that Ashini took down several notable articles including Forbes, CNN, WSJ—while his organization was under suspicion by April 2023—the company claimed that their products were meticulously made and they had consistently maintained their values. The company has drawn criticism from multiple sources, with questions raised about its secretive nature, and faced numerous allegations on whether their business was legal—including a handful of law firms in the financial investigation—a rigorous background check was done which publicized that they operate as an online retailer—with the approval of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee—the materials used by the company were declared legitimate in October 2022. The company also produces high-quality films titled, ""Inspired by best-selling novels"" for customer retention and is investing enormous funds in the development of artificial intelligence. ALPHS headquarters were officially shifted from Hyderabad, India to Milan, Italy in March 2023 under the guidance of Y Combinator, the lead investor of the company.

Based on 20+ years of research from the University of Washington (UW), our hybrid organic electro-optic technology enables low-voltage, low-power, high-performance transfer of data between electronics (the ubiquitous computer chip) and photonics (the technology used in fiber optics, LIDAR, and other groundbreaking technologies). NLM’s technology enables tighter and more efficient integration of electronics and ultra-fast photonics.  NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology is a patented combination of materials and process technologies, enabling efficient EO modulation in datacenter and computing hardware that meets the demand of future growth in networking for AI and other applications. Photonics is transforming networking, computing, and sensing. The largest use to date has been for data transmission and networking in telecom and datacenter infrastructure, using light to efficiently move data over fiber optic networks. Silicon photonics is the incumbent platform for integrated photonics in datacenter network hardware, but signal conversion between electronics and photonics on this platform is power-hungry and cannot scale to sufficient bandwidth to meet future needs in AI and other applications. This has created a need for alternative electro-optic (EO) modulation technologies that can be integrated with silicon photonics and address this bottleneck. Alternate emerging modulation technologies have limitations in bandwidth, device footprint, thermal stability, or cost and complexity of integration with silicon photonics and conventional CMOS VLSI electronics. NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology uniquely solves these issues. It can be retrofitted into silicon photonics processes in late-stage advanced packaging steps, minimize changes to complex chipmaking processes and infrastructure while providing superior modulator power efficiency (10-1000×) and enabling scalable bandwidth. The technology can be deployed through multiple fabs as a semiconductor IP block for broad reach, and has been demonstrated at leading translational research fabs, leading to extensive recent interest by hyperscale datacenter operators and commercial fabs. NLM’s deployment is also accelerated by strategic investors including TOK (a major photoresist manufacturer with extensive materials supply agreements with fabs) and photonics components leader Hamamatsu Photonics.",,"Greater Seattle Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Science and Engineering",5,"Bruce Robinson, Ph.D., Delwin L.

At first, The DAO will focus on projects related to the sharing economy and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications of the blockchain – though the organization said it is interested in exploring other “new markets unlocked by blockchain technology.”The DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO”) - more specifically, it is a new breed of human organization never before attempted. The DAO is borne from immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code, operated entirely by its members, and fueled using ETH which Creates DAO tokens. Several aspects of this structure make it revolutionary: Inclusion: The DAO leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone, anywhere in the world can be empowered to participate. In exchange for their early help, participants receive DAO tokens which hold many benefits. Flexibility: The DAO backs Proposals which it selects for their innovative nature, to be delivered by Contractors. Some of these Proposals could hold no promise of return whatsoever (in the case of a charity for example), others could involve the building of products or services which The DAO could then use for its own purposes. Profitability and Growth: The DAO charges for the use of its the products or services. This revenue is then sent directly to The DAO in the form of ETH. The DAO then has the option to accumulate this ETH to support its growth, or redistribute it to the DAO Token Holders as a reward. Autonomous Governance: The ETH held by The DAO will never be centrally managed. DAO Token Holders are able to vote on important decisions relating to the management of The DAO, including the power to redistribute its ETH amongst themselves. The DAO, represented by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain at address 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, intends to back a series of Proposals to create products or services. The DAO Token Holders will then leverage these products or services, or charge others for using them. In June 2016, users exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code to enable them to siphon off one-third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account. On 20 July 2016, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract. This was controversial and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active blockchains, each with its own cryptocurrency. The DAO was delisted from trading on major exchanges such as Poloniex and Kraken in late 2016.",https://www.facebook.com/DaoHub-449275668615585,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Payments, Professional Services, Software",,,,1,,2016-05-22,163000000,USD,163000000,Initial Coin Offering,163000000,USD,163000000,Initial Coin Offering,163000000,USD,163000000,163000000,USD,163000000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It offers various features to overcome the common challenges faced by businesses including; disorganized work, lack of focus, miscommunication, uncertain team morale, and inadequate planning. With AI power, it plans your day for you. We believe that to achieve success as a team, it's important for each individual to effectively plan their day and adhere to the plan. During the planning stage, 3 main questions need to be answered: “what do I need to work on?”, “how long will it take?” and, “how much time do I have?”.  Planning is important, but not enough by itself for success. Individuals need to maintain their focus throughout the execution of the plan. For ultimate focus, it is essential to minimize the distractions caused by unnecessary messages, switching between unfinished tasks, and losing track of time. With BeforeSunset’s workspace, you can plan your day by reviewing yesterday’s achievements, and unfinished tasks. You can stay on schedule throughout the day by keeping track of time for each task and focusing on one task at a time.  By tracking the time spent on each task, you can ensure that work is progressing as planned and make adjustments as needed. With analytics provided by BeforeSunset close your day by reviewing and reflecting on the progress you made. This detailed daily and weekly analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and plan your future work accordingly. Since work is not all we have, it is important to include personal planning in your day to make sure your daily plan is accurate. This doesn’t mean all your teammates see your personal todos on BeforeSunset. Our tool has the capability to make todos private if the user chooses. BeforeSunset's ""Team Timeline"" feature is designed for team members to share updates with the team such as; the task they're currently working on, their availability, meeting status, daily mood, whether they're working remotely or on-site, and who is currently working or taking time off. This helps keep everyone on the same page, prevent miscommunication, and minimize the need for additional communication.

Instead of off-the-shelf standard-sized implants to treat patients with bone deformity, Meticuly provides state-of-the-art pre-operative planning, surgical guides, and implants that are tailored to fit individual patients. 	The implant solution is built on two proprietary technology platforms: AI-assisted design using a cloud-based platform for patient-specific biomechanic, and the manufacturing of surgical guides and implants are based on 3D printing technology in GMP certified cleanroom. 	After uploading a CT Scan of a patient to our AI cloud server, medical professionals are then provided with surgical assistance through collaborative software to preview the design. Information such as 3D planning, surgical approach, and implant design customization is provided and adjusted in real-time. 3D-printed implant and surgical guides are then manufactured and delivered to the hospital. Information and post-op results are compared with pre-op planning to constantly improve predictive design algorithms.          With growing clinical information and cadaveric big data, the post-op clinical outcome of each patient has achieved both functionality and aesthetics.
