Founded in 2018 as a spin-out company from the University of Oxford, the world’s #1 research university, Caristo has developed a portfolio of imaging-based and AI-assisted platforms that can be applied to aid the prediction and diagnosis of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Caristo was highlighted by Nature in 2020 as one of the most exciting science-based companies to have emerged from academic labs. To-date Caristo has attracted over £23 million in venture capital investment (nearly US$30 million).    Named first of “7 Technologies That Could Change Heart Healthcare Forevermore” by the Robb Report, the CaRi-Heart technology is Caristo’s flagship offering which aids coronary artery disease diagnosis with improved risk prediction. It applies advanced AI algorithms to routine cardiac CT scans to visualize and quantify coronary inflammation, which is the previously invisible root cause of the disease. Each patient’s CaRi-Heart Report includes several clinical results: (1) the patient specific Fat Attenuation Index (FAI), a novel and patented biomarker for the measurement of coronary inflammation, which indicates the patient’s risk in % relative to a matched peer group; (2) CaRi-Heart Risk, which assesses the absolute 8-year risk of a fatal heart attack (based on both coronary inflammation status and standard clinical risks factors); and (3) coronary plaque-specific characterization and quantification. The CaRi-Heart Analysis is supported by the CaRi-Heart software, which is cloud-based and agnostic to the type of scanner generating the routine cardiac CT images. The CaRi-Heart technology is CE Mark certified under the latest EU MDR with UKCA marking being received in September 2022. CaRi-Heart is limited to research use in the U.S. before the FDA grants marketing authorization.  Multiple patents underpinning CaRi-Heart technologies have been granted in major jurisdictions around the world. In addition, exceptional validation results showing Cari-Heart’s ability to aid the prediction of heart attacks have been published in leading medical journals including the Lancet, JACC, European Heart Journal, and Cardiovascular Research. CaRi-Heart validation and implementation projects have been supported by multiple UK government grants and awards, including the NHS AI Stage 3 Award for real-world evaluation and implementation of CaRi-Heart care pathway in multiple NHS hospitals. With its deep clinical insights, proven validity and implementation readiness, the CaRi-Heart Analysis Service and the resulting new care pathway can transform cardiac care around the world by aiding in better prediction and prevention of future heart attacks.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,"Charalambos Antoniades, Cheerag Shirodaria, Keith Channon, Stefan Neubauer",51-100,3,Early Stage Venture,2023-04-17,16292677,USD,16292677,Series A,16292677,USD,16292677,Series A,29914338,USD,29914338,29914338,USD,29914338,"Oxford Science Enterprises, BGF Ventures, Longwall Venture, Oxford University Innovation, Oxford Investment Consultants LLP",4,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2023-04-17,,,,25,,,,0,6,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,11680,USD,11680

Around 5 yrs. before, the founders, Ashwini Jain & Nikhil Jain, saw the problems faced by study abroad aspirants in getting standardized, end-to-end, & authentic guidance in planning to study abroad. Thus, they started a mentorship service under the brand of ForeignAdmits to help students who aimed to study abroad with experiential guidance, & some tried & tested frameworks. From their own experiences of getting double scholarships in Master'smaster's & fully funded Ph.D. & experience of guiding over 5000 students from their alma maters in India, they understood the gap in awareness & the need for experiential guidance. Thus, the foundation of ForeignAdmits was laid.    ForeignAdmits is built to bring trust, efficiency & transparency to the overseas education industry.

The team bringing this vision to life is a diverse and global group of planetary visionaries, scientists, engineers, business leaders, strategists, and technologists with a shared vision for a plastic-free future.  And additionally, we’ve formed a very high caliber scientific advisory board with Dr. Carlos Duarte, a world-renowned marine scientist guiding our seaweed supply chain, Dr. Louis Metzger formerly chief scientific officer at Tierra Biosciences, and Dr. Garret Miyake, an award-winning chemist, Sloan research fellow, and co-founder of Cypris materials.   There’s an increasing number of biobased alternatives on the market, but not all products are created equal.  There are concerns about their true environmental impact as compared to plastic.  Biodegradability is one critical factor to consider, but we must also look at the carbon footprint.  Some current options such as paper straws carry a carbon footprint of 2-3X more than plastic itself while others have made false claims around their biodegradability.  A better future necessitates an alternative that is proven to be compostable, carbon negative, and scalable.  LOLIWARE was just awarded top product of the year from Environmental + Energy leader because they believe we have the ability to set a new industry standard for single-use plastics  Our first product is a home compostable, ocean safe, tree-free, drinking straw.

Today, the GnosisDAO treasury has effective control of over 150K ETH and 8 Million GNO tokens, with the GNO tokens vested over 8 years.  A year later, in 2021, the xDAI and GnosisDAO communities voted to combine their vibrant ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain: An Ethereum forerunner companion that addresses scaling issues through solid engineering. Gnosis Chain is the associated execution-layer EVM chain for stable transactions. It uses the xDai token and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users. The Gnosis mission has always been centered on experimentation and building decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate information. While creating the prediction market platform, it became clear that Gnosis needed to build the infrastructure required to support it.  As a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem. Gnosis Safe (multisig and programmable account), Cow Protocol (formerly CowSwap and Gnosis Protocol), Conditional Tokens (prediction markets), Gnosis Auction, and Zodiac (standard and tooling for composable DAOs) are all products incubated by Gnosis. Their success is demonstrated by the recent spin-out of Cow Protocol and the formation of SafeDAO.

Utopia tries harder than anyone else to get you into your dream home and have you earn from your monthly payments besides giving you the option and not the obligation to buy the home if you like it. Utopia, as a real estate technology company, is driven by the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) principles and has a deep focus on social impact by helping people become homeowners and achieve a slice of their American dream.   The company is backed by 3X founders who have multiple decades of experience in real estate finance and technology with companies like Bank of America and Citibank where the founding team helped over 1 million families get their dream homes. During this journey, the founding team understood even better the emotional need of a family to own a home along with the financial independence and the wealth generation that happens for homeowners.
