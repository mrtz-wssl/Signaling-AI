The SolCold material is no thicker than a business card. How does it work? Once applied to a surface of an object, the sun’s radiation triggers a reaction in our material. This reaction converts the heat accumulated in the object into radiation.

The disease affects hundreds of millions around the globe; even in developed countries more than 50% of the patients are currently undiagnosed, and more than 38% are going blind despite being treated. The need for monitoring eye pressure outside the clinic has been defined as an urgent need by scientific, medical, and industry leaders in ophthalmology that will help improve clinical outcomes.  Smartlens’ flagship product miLens is a non-invasive and convenient way of monitoring eye pressure for anyone anywhere at any time. It will help improve early diagnosis, enable personalized treatments, and disease monitoring thus reducing the prevalence of blindness, treatment costs, and its huge burden on lives and economies. miLens is utilizing a novel, electronics-free sensor technology that is fully owned by Smartlens, Inc. and protected by its portfolio of issued and pending patents covering more than 40 countries. The Company's novel technology is also being studied at Stanford University Labs for monitoring (ICP) which is associated with certain neurological disorders, and cancers.  Smartlens also owns a non-invasive drug delivery technology that monitors the IOP and releases the right medication at the right time which will help improve efficacy, patient compliance and reduce the side effects.

Monoclonal antibodies have transformed the treatment of human diseases, including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, cancer, severe infections and many rare conditions over the course of the past two decades. Bi-specific antibodies are engineered from two different monoclonal antibodies and combine their key features into one molecule. As a novel drug class, bi-specifics provide additional options for the treatment of many life-threatening diseases such as cancer. However, even minor modifications to any pharmaceutically active biologic such as an antibody can significantly change the properties critical to its development, such as its binding properties, the pharmacokinetics, its stability, solubility and the ability to produce it in sufficient quantities at reasonable costs. This challenge has prevented a majority of bi-specific antibodies of potential interest to scientists and clinicians from advancing into clinical development because their drug-like features were compromised.

Their goal is to help new businesses build and run a strong, cost-efficient and sustainable customer support infrastructure. The importance of having a proper infrastructure in place cannot be overstated. As companies expand, they tend to become overwhelmed by the growing demand. Every new company reaches a point where something’s gotta give. Their team is here to take the reins on your support operations so that you can move forward with your vision, unhindered. They learn the ins and outs of your company’s product so that they can take the front lines in managing your customers’ satisfaction. Every company is paired with a US-based account manager whose primary job is to ensure that the team is not only meeting their expectations, but exceeding their KPIs – whether those are conversion rates or CSAT scores. Maybe it’s their team. Maybe it’s their innovative system. Maybe it’s their inclination toward perfection. Whatever it is – they help businesses grow without the growing pains. The company’s roots began long before it was founded in 2014. SupportNinja’s Cody McLain founded a previous venture, PacificHost. A hosting company at heart, PacificHost would grow to provide managed virtual and dedicated servers in its Dallas-based datacenter. In just four short years, the company grew to service over 30,000 websites and 7,000 customers in over 100 countries worldwide.

Offering the greatest hospital administration software to the nation was the unique notion at the heart of this project.

The complexity of the process is due to the fragmented nature of the health technology system, which necessitates the use of multiple systems to manage the workflow. Our ability to comprehend these problems and address them at their core was aided by our cumulative expertise of more than 10 years in the HealthTech industry. Hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and labs workflow were all streamlined by NuvertOS' creation of ONE system to replace them all. Specialized processes that are part of our offering allow the system to be configured and customized to the demands of the user. Our Service quickly made this action a reality, moving from one hospital to the next, clinic to clinic, and city to city. In the upcoming years, we will keep bringing top-notch healthcare management software to a growing number of institutions through an ever-expanding portfolio.
