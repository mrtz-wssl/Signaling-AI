The primary reason is cost: the majority of therapists do not accept insurance, meaning paying for therapy is prohibitively expensive for prospective patients. This is where we got our start – Headway has built the first software-enabled network of therapists who accept health insurance, making it easy for therapists to grow their practices, and possible for patients to find quality care they can afford.  We launched in April of 2019 and are now powering 300,000+ appointments per month. To scale our vision, we’ve raised over $100 million in funding from a16z, Thrive, Accel, and Google Ventures.

The clinical impact of cell therapy in treating cancer has been proven, but this therapeutic approach has several limitations, especially in manufacturing, leaving extremely sick patients waiting for treatment and desperate for hope. Since cell therapy is currently produced for a single patient at a time, it is expensive to manufacture, requiring significant time and resources, and is difficult to scale.  Preclinical and clinical scientists, as well as commercial cell therapy manufacturers also lack the options to fully automate their manufacturing process quickly, safely, cost-effectively, and at the scale they need. The Cell Shuttle is an automated and closed end-to-end manufacturing solution that is flexible and scalable, enabling customers to run exact processes specified for their cell therapy. Compared with the current manual manufacturing processes for cell therapy, the Cell Shuttle’s next-generation automated manufacturing solution has 10 times the scalability (meaning 10 times more patient doses can be produced simultaneously), enables a three-fold reduction in process failure rates, and will reduce the per-patient manufacturing cost by up to 70 percent for most processes.;;San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering;3;Alex Pesch, Fabian Gerlinghaus, Omar Kurdi;51-100;3;Late Stage Venture;23.08.23;255000000;USD;255000000;Series C;255000000;USD;255000000;Series C;355000000;USD;355000000;355000000;USD;355000000;Bristol Myers Squibb, 8VC, Eclipse Ventures, Koch Disruptive Technologies, DFJ Growth;3;9;;;;;;;Private;;;;;;;;;;;11.10.21;;;480.39%;52;;;;3;8;Biochemistry;;;;;

Buildings are the most complex controlled infrastructure in the world, however, they are often fitted with technologically stagnant and expensive control systems that waste energy and provide sub-optimal occupant comfort. The consequence of this inefficiency is that buildings account for more than 40% of the entire world's energy usage.  Autonomous buildings are the key to addressing this energy challenge and unlocking the future of cities. PassiveLogic’s autonomous building platform, powered by Quantum - the physics-based digital twin standard for autonomous systems, has proven 30% energy savings compared to conventional control systems. Applying this scalable technology across the entire U.S. building sector alone creates a net savings opportunity of 9.6 Quads per year—the equivalent of taking 1/3 of all U.S. vehicles off the road. Founded in 2016 by Troy Harvey and backed by the world’s leading investors, PassiveLogic’s team is committed to developing extraordinary products that tackle the most challenging sustainability issues.

What if, within minutes of a new threat being reported – anything from supply chain attacks like 3CX or SolarWinds, the latest ransomware variant, or Log4j-style vulnerability – you received an authoritative, automated report on your organization's status regarding the threat? Either a completely ""clean bill of health"" or telling you that your organization WAS impacted, exactly WHERE, and exactly WHEN. Fully automated, powered by AI and machine learning, with absolute ""ground truth."" What if you had a neural network at your fingertips, capable of providing accurate threat evaluation, severity assessment, and tracking of not only a specific threat but all of its variants across your enterprise, instantaneously. What if you could write threat informed detections in YARA and run near instantaneously and continuously over every executable file that's ever been in your organization.

At Dutch, we’re on a mission to treat the curable ailments that keep our pets from living their best lives. Many of our pets suffer from chronic conditions such as allergies and anxiety. Sadly, many also go untreated. Traditional vet appointments are inconvenient, expensive, and often stressful for our best friends. This leads to putting off wellness visits until a pain point is unignorable and frequently pushing quality-of-life issues under the rug. This is the reality of pet healthcare in the U.S. — but we know we can do better.  By using telehealth solutions to connect pet parents with licensed veterinarians, Dutch makes veterinary visits convenient and practical. Dutch-affiliated vets work with your pet over time, whenever they need it, allowing our veterinarians to go beyond the symptoms and identify the root cause of your pet’s chronic suffering. We prescribe treatments and prescriptions that are medically backed, specialized to individual cases, and delivered directly to your door.
