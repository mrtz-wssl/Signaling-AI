Not just plain data, but suggested actions that can help to improve on these improvement points.  Always. Player. Specific.  Even though football is the number one sport in the world, it falls behind when it comes to the usage of factual, objective data. In a tech-savvy world most training, coaching and scouting are still done purely based on plain, subjective data. Especially in youth football. Even in the best football academies, talented youth players are still developed in a conservative context.   However, data technology gets slowly more accepted. Just as the insight that youth development is key to a club’s success becomes more and more visible. With 3.000 pro and 600.000 amateur clubs, containing a total of 200.000.000 youth players, football needs an upgrade. JOGO allows the football community to do just that: use data to get better.

The company developed and manufactures the XTAL, a virtual and mixed reality headset with the highest fidelity, resolution, and the widest field of view available. The latest XTAL 8K headset won the prestigious Red Dot Product Design Award in 2020. Vrgineers’ simulator portfolio includes portable trainers ready to be packed and taken on mission; reconfigurable classroom simulators that support almost all platforms, from the T6 Texan to the F35; and custom 1:1 simulators that are built specifically for any type of helicopter, jet-fighter, or airliner, including a fully-functional cockpit replica. All simulators employ the XTAL headset featuring a market-leading 180° field of view at 8K resolution with the option of a mixed-reality module.    All these simulators were developed in close cooperation with professionals, including airline, military, and acrobatic pilots. Extended simulation capabilities improve the pilot experience. The system delivers the highest level of situational awareness, increases first-time pass rates, reduces re-flights, and diminishes expensive repeat events. It can be used for all rotary and fixed-wing training requirements from front-line aircraft conversion units. The pilot training system leverages the option of complex mission training with joint communication for multiple users.    VRgineers actively improves the training experience for clients like the U.S. Air Force, U.S Navy, the Royal Air Force, Lockheed Martin, Gulfstream, BAE Systems, NASA, and other technological pioneers. VRgineers has proven expertise in designing and integrating cost-efficient, scalable, customizable, and wide-ranging synthetic training solutions. Recognized as a technological leader, VRgineers was selected by the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program within the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) to develop a next-generation mixed reality pilot training solution, and by the U.S. Air Force to deliver multi-purpose reconfigurable simulators.    Besides the aerospace industry, VRgineers’ technologies are being used to design revolutionary products and remotely control heavy machinery. For example, VRgineers delivered virtual reality solutions for brands such as Audi, Skoda, Lamborghini, McLaren, RedBull, and Westfield.   VRgineers was co-founded in 2017 by CEO Marek Polcak and currently employs an international team of 50 professionals that combine a high level of technical skills (mostly Ph.D. and Engineer graduates in R&D) with industry professionals.

Ecov accompanies businesses and communities in achieving carpool solutions. 80% of trips in France are made by private car. This has huge environmental and economic consequences – in France private cars account for 16% of greenhouse gas emissions and eat up 14% of the average household budget. Reliance on cars is also a major social concern, with 54% of people living on a low income having to turn down work due to lack of transport. Moreover, on a day-to-day basis, the average car carries just 1.3 people, meaning that the road transport system (roads + vehicles + users + networks) is not being used efficiently. Carpooling (sometimes also referred to as lift-sharing, car-sharing or ride-sharing) is one solution. However, although carpooling is now a popular choice for long journeys, only 3% of day-to-day trips are made using conventional, pre-booked carpooling services. We believe we can change this. To change behaviours and reduce the number of solo drivers on the roads, we need to re-think how carpooling works. The constraints inherent in pre-booked carpooling are a barrier to uptake. That’s where our new concept – the carpooling line – comes in. Designed to operate like a typical bus line, with a designated route and stops, it allows people to carpool spontaneously, without booking. Drivers make their trip as usual, leaving whenever they want and picking up passengers along the way. At peak times on our busiest lines, passengers wait no longer than 5 minutes for a ride, just like on a high-frequency bus line.",https://www.facebook.com/ecovfrance,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Community and Lifestyle, Information Technology, Software, Transportation",2,"Arnaud Bouffard, Thomas Matagne",51-100,9,Early Stage Venture,2023-05-10,11800000,EUR,12959855,Series A,11800000,EUR,12959855,Series A,15453000,EUR,17316170,27478000,EUR,30915092,"BNP Paribas, EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs, MAIF Impact, Banque des Territoires, ADEME Investissement",2,10,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,-46.11%,36,,,14,1,0,Computing; Calculating,,,,

The Alphamer technology is based on ""programmable immunity"" in which chemically synthesised molecules redirect naturally occurring antibodies to selected pathogens to fight the infection. The molecules have two distinct parts: one end binds a cell-surface target on the pathogen using an aptamer whereas the other end presents specific epitopes that attach to the circulating antibodies. It has been demonstrated that Alphamers have the potential to redirect pre-existing antibodies to bacteria in a specific manner and trigger an immediate antibacterial immune response, so clearing the infection.  Centauri Therapeutics’ strategy is to redirect naturally occurring antibodies to target disease. Centauri Therapeutics' unique Chemistry Platform provides a flexible scaffold to enable the synthesis of specific Alphamers. These are bifunctional molecules which present a selective cell binding moiety as well as an epitope that recruits pre-existing antibodies, resulting in cell killing.

Proteomics is about the study of proteins in a biological mechanism, both their individual function and their combined interactions. For clinical proteomics the goal is to be able to quickly and efficiently compare a biological sample against a profile panel of selected proteins in order to deliver a diagnose / verdict of healthy or diseased (within given statistical margins). Such a profile is typically called a biomarker and for official approval, it must be demonstrated successfully on a large population.

The price risk is transferred to the opposing side of the market where “Makers” supply an alternative cryptocurrency that has a lower volatility; typically, a “stablecoin”. Both the protected asset and the stablecoin deposited by Takers and Makers are held by the protocol in pools. Stablecoins are at risk for the benefit of Takers in the event of certain negative price events, and Taker assets incur a variable premium in the native asset for the benefit of Makers. Both the volatile cryptocurrency and stablecoin pools are partially subordinated, allowing actors to engage with the protocol according to their individual perspective on future price behaviour of the protected asset. The Bumper design demonstrates how a decentralised software marketplace for asset price risk might prove superior to more traditional methods of using centralised stop-loss (which incurs slippage), or options markets (which has parasitic profits and overheads), by re-organising the utilities of the market participants.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Payments, Software",2,"Gareth Ward, Jonathan DeCarteret",1-10,2,,2021-10-12,20000,USD,20000,Venture - Series Unknown,20000,USD,20000,Venture - Series Unknown,10020000,USD,10020000,10020000,USD,10020000,"Alphabit Fund, Autonomy Capital, Chainlayer, Beachhead Venture Capital, Metaconomy Capital",,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-61.78%,55,,,,,,,,,,

It’s time to take control of IoT.   In 2017, the Simetric team recognized an underlying need in the IoT industry- the lack of fundamental support and expertise in IoT cellular connectivity management. The existing connectivity platforms deployed by operators were built with a proprietary focus, impeding any company’s ability to manage their IoT instances across operators effectively. With the initial focus of many IoT efforts being largely automation, the limitations of competing IoT platforms were not fully recognized.  At the forefront of Simetric’s original vision was the customer.  We created a new platform that encompassed a unified management pane that established for a company - of any size and any type - the tools to centrally manage all connectivity needs in a Single Pane of Glass.  In 2019, the company looked at what the next phase of IoT could become to unify connectivity and device performance to enable companies to not only unify non-conforming IoT platforms but also to move IoT business process execution to the device effortlessly across all the operators’ IoT platforms.  We then enlisted proven executives from Microsoft, Cisco, and Verizon to further accelerate our thought leadership that unified the strengths of the cloud with the network and efforts of operators.    With the global IoT market scaling into billions of cellular connections and the next horizon of needs driven heavily by 5G and autonomous driving, companies will need an IoT platform that is highly extensible and analytical for them to evolve their businesses with these technology advancements.
