Their engineers have developed sophisticated techniques to predict upcoming signal states. Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format.",https://www.facebook.com/Connected-Signals-152962808055458/,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Platforms, Software, Transportation",2,"Matt Ginsberg, Ravindra Kondagunta",1-10,10,Private Equity,2020-12-27,,,,Convertible Note,,,,Private Equity,2492199,USD,2492199,2792199,USD,2792199,"Plug and Play Ventures, Toyota Ventures, Sand Hill Angels, Tech Coast Angels, Benhamou Global Ventures",2,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,29,4,5,17,0,1,,"Transport, packaging and storing",,,

The company, which is on a mission to transform lifestyles, says the wellness apps are meant to confront an epidemic of unhealthy lifestyles through the use of proprietary AI technology. One app is aimed at adults and uses AI to deliver accessible personal training at home, while the other combines education and movement, and is aimed at children ages 4 to 8. The apps are meant to act as a countermeasure to people who inhabit a world where hours are spent at desks every day, and children spend increasing amounts of time in front of their screens. In June 2021, the firm raised US$2.3 million from angel investors through seed funding, at which point the company was valued at $20 million (USD).

Così facendo vengono ridotti i costi del personale impiegato, oltre a ridurre l’inquinamento richiesto per la raccolta. L’intelligenza artificiale permette così la riduzione di costi sub-ottimizzati, oltre a migliorare la qualità della raccolta differenziata, che si traduce in importanti incentivi e premi, che possono essere utilizzati per recuperare l’investimento iniziale. Inoltre, le informazioni derivanti dai rifiuti permettono di ricostruire le abitudini di consumo degli utilizzatori, permettendo quindi di destinare loro pubblicità sullo schermo del cestino che sarà incredibilmente mirata e precisa.Hoooly! è un cestino intelligente, Unnuovo dispositivo intelligente, nato dal recupero dei materiali delle paleeoliche dismesse di Enel green Power, semplifica il processo di smaltimento dei rifiuti grazieall’intelligenza artificiale.

This demand is further intensified by regulatory scrutiny, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Directive, which requires European companies to measure and report their material impact on communities and supply chains. Additionally, the SEC is cracking down on cause-washing and green-washing claims, holding public companies accountable for their social impact commitments. On the other hand, impact-producing organizations, like nonprofits and social enterprises, struggle to receive funding based on their efficacy rather than reputation. Despite their agility and crisis response capabilities, only a small fraction of international humanitarian aid reaches these local organizations. Their time is consumed by fundraising efforts, grant applications, and reporting, limiting their capacity to scale their impact. Enter OutcomesX, the social outcome marketplace that bridges the gap between corporations and impact producers. By providing verifiable impact and equitable capital allocation, the platform empowers impact producers to access global funding and focus on driving meaningful change. The key features of OutcomesX include standardizing, pricing, trading, and reporting on social impact credits, simplifying the process for buyers to connect with the most effective impact producers while reducing administrative burdens on both buyers and producers.

Its cloud-based platform makes it extremely easy for Africans within and outside their home countries to subscribe for regular doctor home visits and home medical care for their parents through the GeroCare application.  This process of enrolment initiates the matching of the parents and/or elderly loved ones to a doctor who is in proximity and who will ensure monthly physical doctor visits take place in the home or any convenient location. The application provides appropriately worded reports on each visit by a GeroCare doctor and the adult child who makes the payments (and any other whitelisted members of the family) receives regular information as to the health status of their parents and/or elderly loved ones with their consent. In addition, the family can pay for any required tests and drugs via the app for direct delivery to the beneficiary.  This solution is cloud-based and co-location of service providers or systems support staff is not required but can be facilitated through technology (for example getting a second physician to co-review a case, laboratory investigations, and any other non-doctor consultation care that may be needed). The elderly beneficiaries themselves do not need an internet-enabled device to access this service as their communication with the doctor to schedule his visits are primarily by phone call however every other health provider participating in the care is connected to the GeroCare software.

Constant sharing with little visibility or control of who has access to what, leads to significant security and compliance challenges. Torsion integrates with your existing collaboration systems, working with business users to monitor and control access as circumstances constantly evolve. Working across Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Office 365 and File Share systems – to improve data security and simplify compliance.  Unlike traditional data governance tools, Torsion focusses on the people in the business, to help them use information securely.

CET is the only entertainment company with the capability of delivering free-roam vehicular experiences while fully immersed in virtual worlds.   Amusement parks are a $51B global market, attracting over 200M attendees in 2020.  It's obvious that consumers want exciting and immersive experiences:  Companies like Disney have leveraged their theme parks to build brand loyalty and franchise popularity through immersive transmedia storytelling.  However, most media companies and consumer brands cannot easily convert their digital content into physical experiences: It’s expensive and hard! CET is able to partner with any content provider, converting their digital content into virtual landscapes and experiences that seamlessly integrate with our proprietary, free-roam holonomic robot (think real-life Mario Kart).  Our vehicle is able to move in any direction, including accelerating while rotating, and is able to replicate motion of vehicles (car, boat, spacecraft, tank, snowmobile, etc).  The vehicles have two modes, “driver” (consumer has full control) or “ride” (CET has full control), making these micro theme parks attractive for the largest range of ages/heights. With a single system and geographical footprint, guests benefit from endless immersive virtual experiences like never before. In addition, CET will be the first E-Sports enabled platform of its kind, where players in different locations can play against each other (persistent leaderboards) or play against each other in real time.  We have provisional patents filed, including asynchronous starting capabilities, which maximize throughput. CET is founded by a trio of experienced entrepreneurs with demonstrated track records.
