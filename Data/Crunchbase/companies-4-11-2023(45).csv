This revolutionary approach was proven to be successful with the launching of the automated yeast cell counters & apps for breweries and wineries: •	Oculyze BB 2.0 (Better Brewing) Yeast Cell Counter App •	Oculyze FW (Fermentation Wine) Yeast Cell Counter App The Oculyze yeast cell counting kit works by using a microscope connected to a smartphone or tablet and the Oculyze app. The images are then uploaded to the cloud where they are analyzed by image recognition algorithms, offering quantitative real-time image analysis.  Breweries and wineries of all sizes around the world have now chosen to replace the time-consuming and human error - prone standard method (yeast cell count using haemocytometer) with Oculyze, a far more reliable, fast, and cost-saving solution for monitoring fermentation during all the stages of the production process.  While working on constantly improving its flagship products, Oculyze also focuses on bringing the advantages of cloud-based image recognition, like faster development time, lower cost and better image recognition to other applications such as ethanol and bioethanol (or ethanol fuel) production, blood or sperm counts, parasite detection in feces, asbestos fiber detection, emulsion analysis, and bacteria detection, thereby continuing to add applications to its cloud-based image recognition platform.   Oculyze can offer turnkey solutions to businesses, integrating three essential components – the image analysis platform (for data storage & backup, user authentication, and task handling), a custom image analysis & recognition software and the image capture software developed by Oculyze.

There is a very important belief behind everything we do: we believe that the destiny of every atom is to become an electron. And precisely when an atom is turning into an electron is when the grand investment opportunities emerge.  Think about it, this occurred with media (all the money that once flowed into the atoms of magazines, newspapers, radios, and TVs is now in the electrons of social networks, search engines, e-commerces, etc.), with financial products (in the past, banks had a branch on every corner, but today there's a branch in everyone's pocket), with software (the older generation will recall buying software CDs at newsstands or having numerous servers within companies, today much of this is in the cloud), and with entertainment (no need to mention that books, music, and films have become apps on your phone) and so forth. It's precisely for this reason that our investment thesis is centered on identifying the largest industries currently transitioning from atoms to electrons and investing in and backing the entrepreneurs who are best equipped to accelerate this transformation. Therefore, our investments are highly agnostic, covering areas like financial services (Conta Simples, Ume, and Justos), identity (Unico), pharmaceutical industry (Menten AI and Pepper Bio), diagnostics (Huna), media (Festalab, Prota, and Newtail), primary education (Studdy), energy distribution (Lemon), devtools (Lazy AI, DataMilk, NuMind, Croct), among others.",,Latin America,"Early Stage Venture, Seed",Venture Capital,20,28,1,,1,1,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Lending and Investments",2,"Alexandre Mello, Luiz Guilherme Manzano",11-50,1,,2019-03-01,,,,Undisclosed,,,,Undisclosed,,USD,,,USD,,Rafael Duton,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,

An entirely novel process enables the user to describe their ideal dataset and launch its generation on AI Verse’s render farm, a scalable cloud-hosted cluster of GPU machines, each able to procedurally build a 3D scene and render photorealistic images in a few seconds. The dataset builder offers simple but powerful inputs for scene description, lighting and camera placement, emulating the work of a 3D artist in just a few clicks. The user specifies a desired type of environment (e.g. living room, bedroom, office) and chooses object classes of interest from a catalog of 1000+ assets in ongoing expansion. These inputs are enough to procedurally generate any desired number of 3D scenes, respecting user-defined constraints while offering the variations in appearance and content necessary to AI robustness on tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. The user can also specify activities to be performed by human agents in the scenes, ranging from simple postures to leisure or work-related activities (e.g. typing on a keyboard, watching TV). A wide range of lighting scenarios can be applied in order to simulate varying weather and time of the day. The placement of the camera is also randomized according to simple and effective constraints that can be defined according to the engineer’s use case. Sensor parameters (e.g lens parameters, depth-of-field, exposure) can also be adjusted. The process of setting and adjusting the scene and image parameters is made interactive and engaging through the use of live previews, allowing the user to visualize within a few seconds an image rendered on-the-fly on one of our GPU machines, corresponding to the input parameters. Availability of GPU machines for previews is guaranteed though a session-booking system. Once satisfied with their inputs, the user can launch the generation of any desired number of 3D scenes and images captured from those scenes, along with their choice of automatically generated labels (e.g. object 2D/3D boxes, instance masks, depth image). Parallelized rendering on the cloud enables delivery of thousands of images in just a couple hours. The dataset management UI enables the engineer to track progress on any of their dataset orders, and visualize a sample of images from a given dataset as soon as it is available. Once the dataset is completed, the user can download it from the cloud by generating an expiring link whenever needed, which enhances data privacy. The downloadable dataset is presented in a format that makes it ready for AI training and easy to combine with other datasets.",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Benoit Morisset,1-10,1,Seed,2021-09-01,2500000,EUR,2960373,Seed,2500000,EUR,2960373,Seed,2500000,EUR,2960374,2500000,EUR,2960374,Turenne Capital,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,

This technology consists of an isolation platform, which automatically performs the necessary steps to process the sample, capturing the CTCs contained in it, and an imaging system, which possesses special routines and machine learning algorithms that analyze the captured cells based on their morphology and the expression of specific markers. The fact that all these processes are fully automated increases the reliability and reproducibility of the assay by preventing human errors and cell loss due to manual steps. Furthermore, the collected cells are compatible with traditional molecular biology techniques and next-generation technologies, enabling the performance of molecular analysis to assess the genetic characteristics of the captured CTCs.

Bobcoin, an asset-backed coin, is the first instance in the world of cryptonization by a for-profit social enterprise. The innovative model of the Bobcoin Program offers the best of both worlds – it combines the flexibility and freedom of a distributed blockchain-based asset with tangible real-life businesses.  The fundamentals of Bob Eco started in 2017, when the founders began providing small loans to individuals across emerging markets. The founders went on a mission with a far-reaching impact. The idea was simple—use asset finance, technology, and a customer-centric model to help informal sector entrepreneurs dramatically increase their economic trajectory, thereby creating over 200,000 jobs. Bob Eco started to build a long-term ecosystem for micro-entrepreneurs to grow and thrive as their partner, from financing to value-added services to new opportunities. The social impact Bob Eco has had and continues to have is massive. The benefits of access to low interest asset financing include: 1 - Enabling entrepreneurs to start or expand micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. 2 - Savings help families build assets; they can finance school fees, improve homes (e.g., install power or running water), and achieve goals. Bob Eco observed that over 94.3% of all loan requests were used for taxi vehicle financing, and therein lies the problem. Considering that millions of motorcycle taxis operate in African countries, with some driving up to 16 hours a day, often covering hundreds of kilometers daily, Bob Eco was helping to move people out of extreme poverty by majorly threatening human and environmental health. Bob Eco actively promoted a significant source of carbon emissions—ubiquitous fuel-powered motorcycles—and this CO2 spewing was a considerable obstacle. Bob Eco decided that it could no longer pollute the environment in this way. The day Bob Eco stopped providing credit for CO2-spewing taxis was a good day for electric transportation in emerging markets. Bob Eco changed this concept to make all the motorcycle taxis electric and now offers its electric vehicles to local people on a lease-to-own basis, meaning that they can own the Bob electric motorcycle after a maximum term of 36 months. Training, life and medical insurance, and high-quality safety gear are all included, and Bob's staff actively support clients to reach their ownership goals. Bob Eco offers users the world's first mass-market electric vehicle that costs less to acquire, maintain, and operate than a fuel vehicle. On average, motorcycle taxi riders spend USD 4.40 daily on fuel and make an average daily profit of only USD 1.50, which they take home to their families. Bob riders save around USD 4.40 on fuel a day, which means they earn almost four times as much as a petrol motorcycle taxi. All the income from Bobcoin sales is invested into electric vehicles, making Bob Eco the first crypto company to use cryptocurrency to solve real-life problems with tangible, high-class, technological products.",https://www.facebook.com/Bobecoltd/,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Transportation",,,501-1000,3,,2022-06-22,100000000,USD,100000000,Initial Coin Offering,100000000,USD,100000000,Initial Coin Offering,120000000,USD,120000000,120000000,USD,120000000,The Global Emerging Markets Group,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,

The application uses the data contained in Building Information Models (BIM) to overlay the worksite using augmented reality using mobile devices.  This allows different stakeholders involved in the building process such as construction site managers and craftsmen to surveil and closely monitor the construction site as the construction progresses. Errors on the site (e.g. missing openings in walls for the piping) as well as errors in the 3D BIM model can easily be detected and prevented from happening at early stages of the building process. For this, GAMMA AR provides users the functionality to mark errors and make text/photo/voice annotations. These annotations are visible to all involved stakeholders in the app as well as in a central web service. This way the usual manual communication between different stakeholders that occurs at different stages of the construction process is automated and much more efficient. Finding construction errors early is crucial, as costs and time to fix errors can drastically increase if the errors remain undetected, causing need for many expensive adjustments.  GAMMA AR therefore yields in not only reduced construction costs but also time savings. Furthermore, GAMMA AR extends its usability even after construction has finished as it helps facility managers in maintaining buildings by providing visualization and communication infrastructure (e.g. visualize cables inside a wall for electricians). Planners and Project Managers can access the data from GAMMA AR in realtime using the GAMMA BIM PORTAL.

LOCIcoin utility tokens are used exclusively within the LOCI suite of products for the purposes of searching, analyzing, staking and exchanging Intellectual Property. LOCI Search provides a unique and patented Venn Diagram IP search tool for FREE (https://www.locisearch.com/) LOCI Invention Analysis helps new inventors determine the novelty and demand (undergoing further development) for their ideas before they spend money trying to patent. This is a huge cost savings of about 95% compared to traditional patent attorney searches. LOCI Invention Analysis can also help guide inventors toward “white space” where there are relatively few existing patents, where demand is high, so the inventor has the best possible chance of being awarded a patent, and/or selling their idea. Inventors can submit multiple iterations to help refine their idea and identify alternative applications of their invention. The ultimate goal of the inventor while using Invention Analysis is to achieve a optimal “LOCI Score” which indicates that their idea is unique, and in high demand. Once an inventor has refined their idea to feel confident that it is unique and in high demand, then they will be able to easily translate their idea into a provisional patent application using the LOCI system that is directly filed with the USPTO (in development), as well as stake their claim on the blockchain, which provides an immutable, undisputable time-stamp of the staked idea. This protects the invention for a period of 12 months at a very low cost.
