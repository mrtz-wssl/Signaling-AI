ToothPic is an official university spin-off of Politecnico di Torino, a major engineering school in Italy and Europe, and is incubated in the university incubator I3P, recently recognized by UBI Global as the best public incubator worldwide.  ToothPic was founded by a team of 4 researchers and professors from Politecnico di Torino, and in 2018 received a seed from VV3TT, an Italian Venture Capital fund dedicated to Technology Transfer from public research. ToothPic technology is protected by 4 patents, and won several prizes in competitions dedicated to startups and twice the Seal of Excellence issued by the European Commission.

Its technology recognizes the unique pattern of invisible imperfections that characterize smartphone cameras to protect cryptographic keys stored on devices, that are commonly used for user authentication, digital signature, blockchain related applications. The additional layer of security represented by this random unclonable feature can be obtained with no additional hardware and related costs.  A Software Development Kit has been developed for Android and iOS. It can be integrated into existing third-party apps and authentication systems, allowing the device possession verification by (de)obfuscating asymmetric cryptographic keys.

Ocansey in 2015 to improve the agricultural value chain in Ghana. Two critical problems within the value chain, which are the lack of an access to market for smallholder farmers in the rural areas, which subjected them to activities of exploitative, buying from middlemen and the lack of a coordinated truck delivery system to cart their commodities from farms to markets to sell. AgroCenta’s idea is to solve these age-old problems by introducing an online sales platform that connected smallholder farmers directly to an online market, which has wider geographic size, to sell their commodities. The end result? Exploitative buying was reduced to the barest minimum since farmers were in control of selling their commodities at prices that were favorable to them. Once a farmer gets offers from interested buyers, the problem of logistics and transportation were sorted using AgroCenta’s patent TrucKR solution that allowed the smallholder farmer in any remote village in Ghana access trucks at the click of a button. You can call it the uber for trucks.

We've made some fantastic progress in the area of processing the material, optical architecture, light engine design and we are on the way to delivery of the AR visor powered smart helmet in early 2021! We have technology relationships with several tier-one EMS (electronic manufacturing service) partners such as FOXCONN, TPK in the area of hardware design, production and a tight partnership with the University of Melbourne EE department, with technical support from MCN (manufacturing center of nano technology of Victoria, Australia) in sub-micron grade optics design and fabrication. We also have agreements with the tier one motorcycle makers, helmet makers, government tenderer to enable AR applications in automated smart warehousing, tactical smart helmet... to help market our AR and smart helmet as a productivity and safety measure.   We are continued to grow our engagement with key partners like Panasonic, FICOSA, idneo; a Barcelona based automotive solution vendor, to enable see-through AR display powered smart car windows to be even seamlessly integrated within the side window to stream information (like playing the role of adaptive side mirror to driver or passengers) and to further make the car window become a mobile advertising billboard on the road. On the sales side, in addition to B2C, government projects, we’ve been also working together with telco companies to subsidize the helmet sales through their channels and further cooperation to best facilitate 5G access coverage through our smart window technology. From 2016, after two years of research and development, mass production began in July for the world’s first smart motorcycle helmet delivered to the market. Some key components used to build up the first model are currently being manufactured.  We come out more smart wearable form factors by step for other applications in medical (contribute in against COVID-19), industrial, military and police, firefighting fields afterwards through B2B, B2G business models to help to make our cash flow positive in 2020.  From the perspective of delivery to end-users, we have the capability with solid track of records to integrate software stacks, manufacture electronic, wireless connectivity products by the team’s  expertise and the concrete partnership with top EMS. The final product manufacturing and assembly can be done anywhere on the planet for our B2C, B2B, B2G clients given by the core technologies and mass production kit are developed in house and owned by JARVISH to offer the easy transfer by CKD to the appointed EMS. Currently, we have had a number of product models made in the States, China, Taiwan, or Vietnam. The assembly of the end product can be made in the location where it sold. JARVISH envisioned owning the mass-production design from the beginning to make sure that the assembly lines can be copied exactly from each other to increase flexibility and to minimize the quality issues. We are in the state of funding B round to raise in the range of 20 million dollars. We want to finish raising the capital by late 2021. The major use of the capital will be in doubling the size of the team to fulfill the delivery at scale and coming long term after-sales service of multiple government contracts.

Doctors today spend hours during Endoscopic Procedures looking at the LCD screens in order to explore, examine and treat various conditions. At Magentiq Eye we put the growing power of Deep Learning, Image and Video Processing to the help of doctors, so they can be more accurate and effective- ultimately saving millions of lives and billions of dollars. Our first product is APDS: Automatic Polyp Detection System, developed to be used in online and offline colonoscopies.  Our APDS (Automatic Polyp Detection System) can point out the suspicious locations of polyps in the videos, increasing the attentiveness of doctors during procedures, thus helping them to reduce their polyp miss-rates. Given the large population that annually undergoes colonoscopy, even a modest decrease in polyp miss-rate can save a lot of lives! The APDS- RT runs on the video feed from the endoscopic camera used by the physician in real time during the endoscopic procedure (currently only on Colonoscopy Procedure). The APDS-OFL is a software that runs in off-line mode on pre-Recorded Colonoscopy Videos.   It is estimated that 40 million colonoscopy procedures are performed every year (almost 40% in the US alone). The ability of colonoscopy procedures to decrease the number of colon cancer cases has been proven without a doubt and their number expected to grow. However, researches have shown that there is about 25% of misses (undetected polyps) in those procedures, misses which can, unfortunately, cause interval cancer. Within this context The APDS can be sold as an add-on to the colonoscopy system or as a service (license per exam), paid by the clinic or hospital.  Once the APDS system would be formally proven, during the next year, to improve polyp detection rate, it could be sold either jointly with the endoscopic equipment providers or it can be integrated in the colonoscopy devices.",https://www.facebook.com/Magentiq.Eye,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Middle East",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Video",1,Dror Zur,11-50,12,Seed,2022-12-23,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,1725500,USD,1725500,6030368,USD,6030368,"Becton Dickinson India, Israel Innovation Authority, Nina Capital, EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs, Norgine Ventures",1,15,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,166.41%,3,,,11,5,1,Computing; Calculating,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

Target personas for Cheerio are Community admin/manager/moderators, top participants or content creators who contribute to the community and consumers who curate content on these communities. Community Life Cycle comprises of 4 phases: 1. Creation & Discovery Phase: Cheerio helps a typical community builder get upto 300 members in just a month. 2. Engagement & Retention Phase: Cheerio helps community builders engage their audience better by automating content creation through RSS feeds, direct chat with a Slack+WhatsApp type UI, creation of paid events, polls, predictions & multimedia. Creators own their SMS, Email and WhatsApp lists and can send one-tap announcements across all of these channels for better retention. 3. Monetisation Phase For creators already monetising, Cheerio helps by creating one-touch payment links for any content they want to monetise, be it a PDF with due diligence of a stock, a secret recipe of butter chicken, or a zumba class over zoom. Currently, creators in India do this via Google Pay and Phonepe screenshots with an extremely manual reconciliation process over WhatsApp or Telegram. After talking to more than 100 of them, we realised it takes them 1.5 hours/day on this task, hence we have automated it completely. 4. Decline Phase: As communities grow in size, noise increases, 80% members become passive and eventually, the community dies out. We plan to soon structure each community as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, with ownership divided amongst the admin, moderators, content creators and curators, proportionate to their referral volume, quality content contributed by them and spam removals. This would ensure not only community admins are rewarded once the community grows in size but also the top content creators within that community and the curators that help filter out good content pieces. Any revenue earned by the community such as a brand partnership will go not only to the admin but proportionately to each member based on their ownership in the DAO, which increases as they contribute to the community more. We make this happen by tying their ownership to the amount of CheerioCoins mined by them from their contributions to the community.",https://www.facebook.com/cheeriosocial/,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Internet Services,,,11-50,3,,2023-06-13,,,,Corporate Round,,,,Corporate Round,87320,USD,87320,87320,USD,87320,"Vertoz, Roman Saini, Rishi Mukherjee, Ramanand Murthy",1,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,49,,,,,,,,

The Totum Risk toolkit includes integrations with the top custodians, broker/dealers, insurance companies, and other third party software providers.  The integrations allow Totum to pull in the account level data to automatically score the clients portfolio and an advisors book of business to assess the portfolio risk.  Other integrations allow for SSO(single sign on), push/pull data from APIs, usage, and custom. Totum has added a Model MarketPlace for asset managers to add their models for advisors to use and compare with their client's portfolios.  Tactical asset managers can also add their own returns.  Advisors can add and uplaod their own models or use the iRebal integration to pull and push their models. Totum offers custom Investment Policy Statements and proposals to meet their compliance needs and requirements.  Totum helps advisors and institutions stay compliant by covering the SEC Best Interest Rule and FINRA's suitability rule. Built around the concept that each individual investor should fully understand their unique risk situation, Totum is the first to consider comprehensive Human Capital Factors in portfolio recommendation: geography, industry, health, family, balance sheet, and where they are on the road to retirement.  With the addition of Big Data and Machine Learning Totum can now alert an advisor or investor of a life event that is impacting their investments and financial goals.
