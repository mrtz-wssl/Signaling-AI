Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity.  Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria. Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data. This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously. Companies can get results up to 40x faster than traditional methods while making their products better.",https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100083688325108,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Software, Transportation",1,Neil Dsouza,11-50,5,Early Stage Venture,2022-10-18,18200000,EUR,17950027,Series A,18200000,EUR,17950027,Series A,18200000,EUR,17950028,18271429,EUR,18031896,"Planet A Ventures, EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs, Translink Capital, Hitachi Ventures, KOMPAS VC",4,7,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-37.82%,8,,,,,,,,190683,USD,190683

Pharmaceutical companies face increasingly difficult choices in the allocation of internal resources to their drug development programs.  With significant P&L constraints and rich pipelines it has become increasingly difficult for many companies to fully fund and advance development all of their drug candidates, especially beyond Phase 2. Mereo has been formed to take advantage of the global pharmaceutical industry's drive for creative ways to progress their clinical development pipelines.   Mereo has acquired an initial mid-late stage portfolio of three exceptionally well characterised novel products for the treatment of diseases with considerable unmet medical need from Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Each of these programmes has a comprehensive dataset for both pre-clinical and proof-of-concept clinical studies.  Additional product opportunities are under evaluation. Mereo's focus is the development of innovative medicines that have the potential to significantly transform the lives of patients suffering from rare and other specialised conditions around the world.  To do this, the Company depends on the combination of its team's expertise in selecting and acquiring product opportunities, creating value in the development pipeline and structuring creative transactions. Mereo's internal expertise is complemented by a unique partnership with a leading global CRO, ICON. Mereo combines the operational discipline and efficiency of a small company with the financial resources to conduct comprehensive clinical studies.  Mereo will rapidly progress each of the products through further value inflection points before partnering or divesting its products.

In respect of FSRs, GT247.com acts as principal to a contract for difference issued to the investor, where the investor will have a contractual claim against GT247.com to the economic benefits and risks associated with share ownership (price movements and dividends) without having ownership rights in the underlying share. Fractional share rights (FSRs) which are issued through a contract for difference, are an over the counter derivative. Unlike whole shares, FSRS do not carry any voting rights. As the investor makes further investments in FSRs and ultimately ends up with a whole share, the contract for difference is closed out and ownership whole share is delivered to the investor. The availability of any share on the EasyEquities platform is based on various factors but is not an indication of value and does not mean that any share is an appropriate investment for you.

Clinicians need molecules that will delay the tumours' spread and empower them with more time to treat localized cancer. Additionally, the current method of stratifying patients at higher risk of metastasis via the node status often does not work, surprising clinicians. The Solution: Mestastop has identified the gaps as to why anti-metastasis drug discovery failed and has created three proprietary platforms integrating cell biology, genetic engineering, machine learning, animal pharmacology and clinical sampling that do the following: 1. Identifies the rate-limiting steps of metastasis, thereby discovering novel first-in-class targets 2. Screening platform to identify compounds that abrogate the rate-limiting steps 3.

Calder engineers next-generation vaccines that will further protect against the most intractable and life-threatening viruses. Viruses have evolved to become shapeshifters that can evade and distract our immune system by hiding some of their most vulnerable sites. History has shown that pandemics are not only lethal but also inevitable. Currently, the vaccines we know best poorly protect against pandemics and other viral outbreaks and leave many at-risk populations unprotected. By combining structure-based design as part of a novel manufacturing process, Calder’s unique 3D-Vaxlock technology generates molecular staples that lock vaccines into their most potent shape. Their initial focus is on generating a universal flu vaccine that protects against all seasonal strains and an RSV vaccine specifically for the elderly. With this platform, they have the ability to create treatments that better protect against life-threatening diseases with exceptional safety, efficacy, and durability.

We help you repeat success and stop wasting money.,"13,515",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://dreamdata.io,https://twitter.com/DreamdataIO,https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamdata-io/,"In B2B, the biggest challenge marketers face is connecting their activities with revenue. There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost.  Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? The bigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential... but also the pain! To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools (e.g. Google Analytics and Facebook attribution), giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality.  We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources: a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions. We couldn’t find one. So we decided to build one ourselves. Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies who have the ambition to be truly data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis.  Dreamdata integrates with just about any commercial tool and traffic source, so your teams won’t be forced to use certain vendors or suites. You’re free to use best-in-class tools! What if you were asked to double next year's ad spend? What if a pandemic strikes and you’re suddenly forced to cut your marketing activities by 50%? What would you do? Do you actually trust your data enough to present a sound way forward? In situations like these, there’s nothing more dangerous than bad data. What might look like a good plan you want to act on can actually be a bad decision in disguise. Is your B2B’s data prepared and ready to go?  By taking care of all the data-crunching, Dreamdata allows demand generation and commercial ops professionals to focus on which B2B go-to-market (GTM) efforts are actually paying off and enables them to repeat the success and stop wasting money.  Our out-of-the-box platform helps you to answer vital B2B marketing questions like which campaigns and channels to stop or scale, what’s the return on ad spend, and how long it takes to acquire new customers. If you’re all about granularity it’s even possible to do attribution to (and between!) every pipeline stage as well. Applying attribution to pipeline stages allows Dreamdata customers to optimize every step of their customer journeys.  With the Dreamdata insights, B2B marketing and sales align like never before. B2Bs need to realize that revenue creation is most effective when it’s done as a team effort. Every touch of every deal is disclosed. No more guesswork. No more opinions. With this unrivaled transparency, it’s not unusual to see campaign effectiveness and marketing ROI improve by more than 50%.",https://www.facebook.com/dreamdata.io/,"European Union (EU), Nordic Countries, Scandinavia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Software",3,"Lars Grønnegaard, Ole Dallerup, Steffen Hedebrandt",11-50,3,Early Stage Venture,2022-12-06,7000000,EUR,7327157,Series A,7000000,EUR,7327157,Series A,12221699,USD,12221699,12221699,USD,12221699,"Seedcamp, PreSeed Ventures, Crowberry Capital, Signals Venture Capital, InReach Ventures",4,9,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,297.51%,45,,,17,0,1,,Scientific and technological services,,,
