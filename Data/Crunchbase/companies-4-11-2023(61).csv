Coupled with the barriers of having the least number of psychologists / therapists in India, mental health issues need an innovative solution to be tackled. The How? Despite 20,000+ apps on mental health, the issues and impact largely remains unaddressed. From habit forming products, to motivational quotes, to short content on everything from depression to anxiety, the net impact is still single digits. Then how do we tackle this problem at scale with all its complexities? The What? Let's agree - the best solution is for everyone to speak to a therapist. Period. Conversations, on this deeply human and complex challenges, with individuals who are trained. The answer lies in keeping the space personal while creating ways in which users start taking their first steps towards wellbeing.  heyy, stands out in this by not removing the human intervention for the purpose of scaling.

We refurbish and rebox used devices into premium phones - making it easier, faster, and more trustworthy. So fewer perfectly good phones go to waste.

Our circular business model – rebox, rehome, repeat – isn’t just designed to give our customers better value, but make a positive impact on the environment and society.  We don’t just reward people for reboxing. We reward the planet by planting 10 trees every time we buy or sell a device and paying to offset each phone’s lifetime CO2 emissions, which helps to fund a whole range of projects to cut CO2. Our goal is to try and make every phone we rehome not just carbon neutral, but carbon positive if we can. We've come to shake up a dated and boring category. To solve inefficiencies. To redefine recommerce. To challenge the status quo. To liberate people from their addiction to linear, and create a circular economy that rewards them for making greener choices and helping to replenish the planet. One device at a time.

We uniquely address the largest unmet need in CSF Management; the high rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt occlusion. VP shunts fail at a rate of 50% within 2 years and 80% within 5 years, contributing to repeat revision brain surgeries (each costing upwards of $40,000).  Conceptualized in 2014 in collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and spun out of Alcyone Therapeutics in 2018, Anuncia’s patented portfolio of technologies provide peace-of-mind through innovation to improve daily quality of life for the millions of underserved patients with hydrocephalus and other CSF disorders and their families, who suffer from the clinical, economic, and emotional burden of repeat revision brain surgery due to VP shunt occlusions. Anuncia’s core platform has an elegant mechanism of action using a simple finger depression of a soft silicone dome located under the patient’s scalp to produce a noninvasive, retrograde flush of the patient’s own CSF to restore flow through an occluded catheter and prevent emergency surgery. ReFlow’s initial clinical evidence of flow restoration and reduction of symptoms via acute intervention flushing with follow-up up to 3 years, led neurosurgeons to evaluate ReFlow for prophylactic occlusion prevention in their high-risk patients. Ground-breaking clinical data, now out up to 2 years with 100% success, suggest ReFlow is safe for at-home, prophylactic flushing by patients or caregivers to extend shunt life and eliminate revision brain surgery. Supported by these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ReFlow Breakthrough Device status in 2021, making it eligible for regulatory and reimbursement advantages. With existing profitable reimbursement, Anuncia plans to launch its next-generation ReFlow Mini product line in Q2 2022 and continue clinical studies to support market adoption and premium reimbursement.  With Breakthrough status and strong health economic advantages to improve hospital quality metrics and support New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for rapid market adoption and premium pricing; Anuncia is positioned to be the leader in CSF management and help patients live fuller lives.  ReFlow’s unique ability to improve patient access to noninvasive lifesaving therapy at home or in the clinic and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs, earned it an Honorable Mention in the Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards and landed it on MDDI’s The Ultimate List of Private Companies to Watch.",https://www.facebook.com/AnunciaInc,"Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Elsa Chi Abruzzo, PJ Anand",11-50,2,Seed,2023-10-20,1000,USD,1000,Seed,1000,USD,1000,Seed,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,Arizona Tech Investors,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,6,0,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,Medical apparatus and instruments,,,

Our mission is to support and collaborate with young, trend-setting companies in today’s fast paced market space, elevating them to a whole new level. We accomplish this by arranging the funds and term capital so that SMEs can focus on the core business leaving the stressful hassles on our experienced shoulders. o	Excellent understanding of a lifecycle of a company.  o	Large product basket  o	Customized solutions for all clients  o	Focus on long term relationship with company rather than deal specific assignments o	Ability to match company’s requirement with tailor made solutions o	Consultative approach  o	Improvised response time  o	Consistently competitive pricing  With the thought of ushering the much needed change to the SME landscape by enabling the SMEs to raise capital with help of technology and transparent methods of syndicating and providing genuine advise to raise capital from banks, LoanXpress aspires to be a one-stop solution for the young and budding companies which need debt capital in the form of loans (secured and unsecured) and working capital finance.",https://www.facebook.com/loanxpress,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",1,Pratapsingh Nathani,11-50,2,Seed,2018-01-01,7800000,USD,7800000,Seed,7800000,USD,7800000,Seed,7893669,USD,7893669,7893669,USD,7893669,"TrustCapital, Avdhoot Deshpande, Vasan Paulraj",1,3,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,14,,,,,,,

To support and ultimately ensure delivery of business-critical applications and services, a distinct architecture has emerged. This complex structure involves dynamic resource sharing over a hyper-converged compute, storage and network physical infrastructure, all supported by a layer of virtualization technologies. This new, integrated approach to data center architecture offers tremendous operational and business advantages to organizations whose success is dependent upon reliable application service delivery. However, data center monitoring solutions and technology developments have not kept pace with this new wave in data center architecture. Current tools have reinforced the established silos that separate applications, virtual infrastructure, and physical infrastructure as well as the supporting IT teams within the data center. As a result, data center teams have no inter-silo visibility and are unable to efficiently connect the dots between infrastructure and application performance. Uila has a transformational vision that addresses this problem, and empowers data center infrastructure and application teams with a revolutionary new collaborative solution that effectively visualizes and automatically correlates application performance to virtual and physical infrastructure root cause. Monitoring application and IT infrastructure in a virtualized data center calls for an equally virtualized monitoring architecture. The Uila vision completely transforms data center monitoring with a game-changing approach that leverages virtualization technology.

Vymex is the first company in the world that is developing a resource that will allow users to effectively isolate the management of a company's basic needs into a single ecosystem. Basic needs are configured by ALL companies, and they do this by combining different software and tools (messengers, tables, documents, etc.). When scaling up, companies often integrate different ERP systems that combine tools to manage baseline needs and project activities. The Vymex application structure includes 4 products that perform all these functions easily. vHub - it includes functionality for creating and managing a company in a mobile app. Just create a structure and add other users to it. vCo-f - a product that helps you properly to own your share in the company, to keep track of development progress, make decisions by the entire membership of the co-founders and to add new ones by selling your share. vChat - messenger for communication within the ecosystem. Separates business communication from personal. Secure data encryption, fast download and file transfer speeds. vRise - A tool for creating CVs and job searches within the ecosystem. In the first commercial year, Vymex can be used by small companies of up to 50 people. Location and niche do not matter. Companies will pay for subscriptions depending on the size and number of structural units. This will be much more efficient than the current business management methods. The product system and the company design everything so that it sells subscriptions immediately to the global market. Released Beta application on IOS and Android. Now there are open tests by users (more than 500) and companies (more than 250). We also developed our own encryption protocol, which is used to implement the entire software architecture, which allows us to create a quality competition on the global market. We spent 14 out of the planned 19 months in active development. We estimated the intellectual property at 14.5 million hryvnias. There are 46 people on the team at the time of beta release. Round A is designed to attract private investment to develop a commercial version of products. This minimizes the risks for investors at an early stage and allows them to easily manage their assets in the future. Today, 0.1 to 10% of the company is for sale. Proposals for funds will be available after the release of the commercial version. We will develop the necessary legal structure and prepare the product to meet the planned results before the release of the commercial version. Project calculations are constantly being refined and developed. The company will start making a profit in 2024. The business model and products allow us to scale the company to a capitalization of $1.8 billion by 2030. Capitalization will start to grow as soon as we reorganize the company into a JSC and conduct the first round of funds. This will significantly increase the company's performance and provide funds to scale the model to the global market.",https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100072402681990,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Other, Software",1,Ruslan Yumagulov,11-50,1,Seed,2021-12-17,1000000,USD,1000000,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,Igor Fostenko,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.45%,16,1,,,,,,,,,

Despite their best efforts, their WordPress sites on mobile devices were slow and sluggish. We got down to work and developed a mobile WordPress theme for them, called Frontity PRO. Our goal: to make it as performant as possible while delivering a remarkable user experience. To achieve that, we built an internal React framework which used the REST API to fetch the content of their WordPress sites, and spent the whole year optimizing it. We faced a lot of challenges and realized that combining WordPress and React wasn’t easy. But at the end, the theme was a success: it was used by more than 20 million readers and proven ideal for building engaging and modern frontend experiences. In 2019 we decided to use all that knowledge and lessons learnt to launch an open source framework, so anyone who wants to use WordPress as a headless CMS with a React frontend could benefit.

Our focus is to produce quality content connected to the market and made available in our adaptive learning platform, which personalizes the learning experience. Witseed's great differential was to reverse the logic of the market, and instead of creating content and going to market to get customers, we created a board with the largest companies in Brazil to curate and validate all content to be produced. Each company that believed in the model, one executive indicated to attend the Board of Education, which was structured with follow-up routines to validate the topics that most interested the companies and have greater impact on the challenges that they are going through. Witseed was born in July 2017, with the following clients: Algar, Braskem, BrasilFoods, Sabesp, Siemens, Fiat, Calcenter Group, Saint-Gobain, Oncoclinics, GRSA, Gerdau, CCR, Natura, Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Random, Ecorodovias and FIERGS. This model resulted in a different monetization strategy, since the companies paid development quotas before the product actually existed, and after having a number of companies in the Board, we started the project. It ended up being a funding in the bootstrapping model, with investment coming directly from our customers, through the revenue sold to them: we opened that the investment to create a niche academy, with thematic content, which in this case was the SSAcademy (Shared Services Academy), was almost 1 million, and to that end, we would form a board of companies, which would divide this amount into equal quotas, thus becoming customers of Witseed. As a benefit, they would pay less to gain access to all developed content and would also participate in a Board of Education, curating all content that was to be developed. SSAcademy's first wave of content was delivered two months ago, and companies are already using, with very positive feedbacks. As an indicator of success, we have after 2 months of launching the first version with our content, about 6,000 professionals in the platform, with a satisfaction rating of 4.76 (on a scale of 1 to 5) as well as having several statements from the Directors and Managers who are our clients, as a case of success and innovation in Corporate Education, from being prominent for the agile development of high quality content, even by participating in the innovation of Content Co-construction between companies.
