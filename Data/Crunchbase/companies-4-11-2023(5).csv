We are offering smart & reusable To-Go Packaging-as-a-Service to gastronomy clients & consumers. In Germany the consumption of take-away, convenience and delivery food & drinks is responsible for about 281 kilotons of single-use packaging waste for immediate consumption and is growing at double digit rates. Most of the time, To-Go food containers, snack boxes or coffee cups have a very short life-span of only 30 minutes after which they are tossed into trash (or litter parks, beaches & the ocean). This is not only a giant waste of economic resources as each single use costs between 15 and up to 0,60€ for a stable bowl/box with a lid. It is a horrendous waste of environmental resources (wood, water, crude oil, metals & energy) that are used to produce this packaging. Therefore, a single use packaging not weighing more than 30 grams can easily come with an ecological backpack of more than 8 kilograms when taking into account all the resources used in production (material intensities taken from Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy). Looking at GHG emissions, the picture is similarly bleak: Using CO2 emission factors and the detailed material mix of the single-use packaging waste analyzed by NABU (German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union), the 281 thousand tons waste from To-Go consumption generated around 556 thousand tons of CO2 or the equivalent of 195k passenger cars per year (assuming an average distance travelled of 15,000km). With the expected rise of take-away, convenience and delivery food, the related emissions are expected to increase at double digit rates as waste volume is expected to increase and as we saw a shift to plastics relative to cardboard or other materials. While there is a growing awareness of the problem, especially in Germany, there is no scalable solution yet and the commonly used alternative of nature-based & ‘biodegradable’ materials like bagasse or PLA also require many resources for production & transport, and have to be incinerated or go to landfill after use as there is currently no way to compost them.",https://www.facebook.com/vytalglobal/,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Fabian Barthel, Sven Witthöft, Tim Breker",1-10,3,Early Stage Venture,2022-03-14,10000000,USD,10000000,Series A,10000000,USD,10000000,Series A,12423749,USD,12423749,12423749,USD,12423749,"IP Group, Rubio Impact Ventures, Grazia Equity, Kai Hansen, Lawrence Leuschner",1,14,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,209.17%,71,7,"4,877",10,,,,,323055,USD,323055

To drive efforts and innovations that result in elegant, effective solutions to some of the healthcare system’s most pressing needs. Mayo Clinic physicians Darryl Barnes, MD and Jay Smith, MD, and business operations expert Aaron Keenan founded Sonex Health in 2014. Sonex Health has developed the SX-One MicroKnife(R) with Meerkat Technology™ to treat carpal tunnel syndrome in a novel fashion, termed Micro-invasive Carpal Tunnel Release. This innovation allows a procedure that once took place in an operating room to be safely and effectively performed in a surgery center or office setting, resulting in rapid patient recovery, improved cosmesis, and reduced costs. The ultra-low-profile SX-One MicroKnife with Meerkat Technology is an innovative surgical device that enables physicians to perform Micro-invasive Carpal Tunnel Release surgery through a single micro-incision under ultrasound guidance, or with a traditional mini-open incision without ultrasound guidance.  The SX-One MicroKnife utilizes a micro-incision that’s up to five times smaller than the incision made during traditional CTR surgery—an incision so small, it can be closed with a small adhesive bandage or strip instead of sutures or stitches.  The result is a low-trauma surgical environment that has been associated with a more rapid recovery.

The primary goal is to create a worldwide network that can transport real-time communications over secure standards-based channels and make it all accessible to developers and businesses using simple SDKs and programming interfaces designed to be powerful but simple-to-use. Audio/Video applications can be built with SignalWire that run in the mobile browser with no additional software and allow an experience that can unlock communications with a virtual office, AI bots, PSTN termination, gateways to remote call centers, and much more.  With the evolving mobile SDK, rich applications can be built as native apps and the other side of every call is not just a ""room"" but a full-fledged routable telecommunications backend with additional programmable control for every call. SignalWire is founded on the principle of work-from-anywhere dating back to the turn of the century and continues that tradition with a fully distributed workforce spanning 16 US states and 11 countries in nearly every inhabited time zone. This remote culture has helped to shape the way our products and services have evolved and have proved to be invaluable amid the pandemic crisis in 2020. The core of SignalWire is made up of several networked nodes transforming the computing power of its host system into IP-based telecommunications relays that are demand-driven and horizontally scalable. The breadth of the SignalWire technology ranges from mature interfaces like SIP and PSTN to state-of-the-art techniques in live video and HD audio. Unlike many ""video chat"" products and services, SignalWire goes well beyond basic capabilities and has dissected every moving part into programmable components that are on the bleeding edge of what is possible. SignalWire is evolving quickly into the first and only software-powered global telecommunications company delivering that as a service at the Infrastructure, Platform, and Application layer of today's communication stack landscape. Additionally, SignalWire is an active participant in the development and furthering of the standards on which the Internet relies for all of its real-time communications techniques.",http://www.facebook.com/signalwireinc,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Other, Video",3,"Anthony Minessale, Evan McGee, Sean Heiney",51-100,5,Early Stage Venture,2022-03-23,,,,Series B,,,,Series B,41600000,USD,41600000,41600000,USD,41600000,"Samsung NEXT, Sequoia Capital, Prosperity7 Ventures, Storm Ventures, Jerry Yang",4,13,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-33.61%,48,,,22,0,2,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

The company is committed to transforming the way providers prescribe drugs, as well as the way manufacturers, develop new drugs. They are building a molecular map of all protein interactions that identifies genomic signatures and links those to disease and predictive treatment outcomes. Using a simple blood sample to analyze RNA, Scipher Medicine can predict if a patient is likely to respond to a targeted therapy before therapy is prescribed. This insight allows patients to start the most effective therapy from day one. For its first commercial product, they have developed PrismRA®, a first-of-its-kind blood test that can predict which patients with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to respond to TNFi therapies such as Humira® and Enbrel® so that such patients can go on alternative approved drugs.   Scipher Medicine is building the future of patient treatment. Most patients who are prescribed blockbuster therapies today don't respond to treatment, costing the healthcare industry billions in wasted drugs while patients continue to suffer. Scipher's platform identifies which drug will work based on the patient's fundamental disease biology, and not based on symptoms, disease classification, or medical bias. A routine blood test predicts which drug he/she will respond to, with our first product focusing on rheumatoid arthritis, ensuring that the most optimal treatment is prescribed from day one. The molecular data generated by our tests are then used to fuel novel target discovery to address a clear unmet medical need in patients who do not respond to any existing therapy.",https://www.facebook.com/ScipherMedicine/,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Albert László Barabasi, Joseph Loscalzo, Marcell Veidner",101-250,6,Late Stage Venture,2022-02-24,110000000,USD,110000000,Series D,110000000,USD,110000000,Series D,227000000,USD,227000000,227000000,USD,227000000,"Neuberger Berman, Alumni Ventures, Khosla Ventures, aMoon Fund, Optum Ventures",5,13,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2021-11-16,,,-18.5%,28,,,,11,6,,Scientific and technological services,323279,USD,323279
