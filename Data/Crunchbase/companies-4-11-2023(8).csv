Whether you use contractors or employees to service your customers or products, your brand reputation is at risk every day.  Qmerit is a software platform that enables you to manage, measure, and motivate your contractors and employees to excel while gaining visibility into their service quality. Qmerit’s patent-pending algorithms allocate the best resource at the best value for every service request. Whenever equipment in a building is being serviced, parts and materials are often required.  Contractors and building engineers purchase over $100B in parts and equipment each year for service, maintenance and retrofits, but no one has successfully aggregated these purchases.  Qmerit has partnered with Avendra to aggregate this spend and use this leverage with suppliers and OEM’s to maximize discounts on parts and materials and provide Amazon-like eProcurement software to access these deep discounts. At the heart of the platform is our Qmerit Contribution Index (QCI™) performance measurement system that is used for your workforce and your suppliers. The QCI is a continuously calculated score based on past performance, callback rates, procedural compliance and more.  Similar to a FICO® score, QCI scores are visible to all key stakeholders, creating a powerful motivation framework that incentivizes desired behavior and provides real-time performance feedback.

Our predictive prep recommendations can save restaurants money on labor and minimize food waste, all while increasing productivity and profitability. By automating the manual process of determining what to prep each day, restaurants can focus on providing quality service to their customers. Our Story With a shared recognition of the long-unaddressed needs of restaurant operators, Matt and Osa co-founded ClearCOGS. Both Matt and Osa have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and pressures faced by restaurants and are dedicated to using their knowledge and expertise to support and empower individuals in the industry. ​ Matt's journey as a restaurant owner was not an easy one.  At just 21 years old, he was given the opportunity to buy a struggling sandwich shop.  The AC was out, you smell that the grease trap hadn't been cleaned in months, no staff, ice buckets on the equipment compressors to keep them from overheating, the list went on and on.  Despite these challenges, Matt worked tirelessly to turn the business around. He put in long, grueling hours and sacrificed his own well-being to get the restaurant back on track and went on to open and operate multiple more locations. Having put in the long, grueling hours and sacrifices required to run a successful restaurant, he knew that there had to be a better way.    That's where Osa enters the scene. Osa, originally from Nigeria, moved to Indiana at the age of 18 to study Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in Champaign (Matt's hometown).  After completing his Masters in Computer Engineering and working for a few years in Silicon Valley, Osa launched his first startup, where he met Matt.  After selling his startup to one of their largest customers, Osa co-founded Fifth Star Funds, a nonprofit venture capital firm focused on investing in minority-led companies in the Chicago region. ​ It wasn't until Matt dove into the world of programming and data science that the idea for ClearCOGS was born.  What started as a project between Osa & Matt to reduce food waste quickly turned into the restaurant industry's first AI operations manager.    Now, ClearCOGS acts as a translator between complex machine learning and the needs of restaurant managers, providing real-time answers to the everyday questions faced by restaurants.  Together, Matt and Osa are dedicated to helping restaurants streamline their operations, reduce their costs, and increase their profits.",https://www.facebook.com/ClearCOGS/,"Greater Philadelphia Area, Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Matthew Wampler, Osayanmo Osarenkhoe",11-50,2,Seed,2022-07-27,950000,USD,950000,Seed,950000,USD,950000,Seed,950000,USD,950000,950000,USD,950000,"MATH Venture Partners, CIC Angels",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-18,,,22.93%,48,,,,,,,,,,

For banks, the Pollinate platform helps them to understand and engage with their customers better and build stronger relationships with their merchants and consumers alike.

Your first day in college, your best friend, your dorms, hanging in the corridors, your school canteen, all nighters before exams & chilling for weeks after exams - our school lives are filled with so many awesome interactions, experiences & memories. In each of them you’re with a friend, never alone! Humans always have, and will always continue to learn from one another. We are a social learning platform that allows us to learn the way we learn best - socially Founded by Stanford grads, Openhouse is backed by Accel and Matrix Partners. We have started building a stellar team from companies like Microsoft, Uber, etc.,  We are headquartered in Bangalore.  Our Approach Covid-19 has reshaped every aspect of our lives and education is no exception. The world is learning to learn online but the main reason why online education hasn’t skyrocketed is because all platforms are designed to simply deliver content (whether pre-recorded or live). Online learning doesn’t feel natural, warm or relatable. Taking an analogy from the gaming world, edtech so far consists of single player games designed only for access but not engagement & retention. The only actions one can take is content consumption and practice via multiple choice questions. We, on the contrary, think education is an immersive multiplayer experience! If our children are going to learn online we will have to make it social. That’s how learning happens best. We believe we’re amongst the first few companies in the world trying to push the boundaries of edtech to a new era of highly social & community driven learning. PS: We believe that we need to hire people who are toughened by failure, not those coddled by success. Our Culture The best classrooms have an awesome learning culture. We think of our organisation as one large classroom, where each of us is a student trying to learn from & teach one another.  We have all sorts of people here: humanists, tech junkies, educationists, designers & wanna be designers! Since we are a small organisation, we function like a tight-knit family where we care for each other’s work but also for each other’s lives. We’ve often heard that the first 50 team members set the culture & pace of an organisation, which is why we take time and carefully pick our team. If you grab a sneak peek into our tribe, you’d find us to be super real. We are all encouraged to call a spade a spade, even if this means disappointing a peer. Coming up with prospective solutions is good, but we care about how well the experience is crafted - aesthetics do matter. Think of Disneyland, Nike, Airbnb, WeWork, Apple: the best folks know not only how to deliver a product/service, but also make it beautiful. Most importantly, we are all students! Right across the team. from engineering to product, community to classroom, we think of how we’d feel if we were students – and this reminds us to keep learning and growing!",https://www.facebook.com/openhouse.study/,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Education, Software",2,"Akshay Rampuria, Yashovardhan Poddar",51-100,2,Early Stage Venture,2022-12-01,11000000,USD,11000000,Series A,11000000,USD,11000000,Series A,17177025,USD,17177025,17177025,USD,17177025,"Accel, Matrix Partners India, GSV Ventures",,3,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67,3,,,,,,,,,

We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs, we can automate the whole development process. At the current stage, the most important resource is a large fleet of robots to validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data. This would help keep us grounded in reality.  To start building up the fleet, we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by 5x and are piloting it on construction sites in Singapore managed by Woh Hup, BHCC, Gin Chia, Soilbuild, and Dragages. We have early leads in the US and Europe as well. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. Grouting is part of virtually every construction project and a highly laborious process, is considered one of the most physically damaging tasks resulting in tilers’ knees and back issues, and thus quality issues would also arise.  We invented a patent pending robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. The operators would only need to reload grout and water.

DeSo is backed by Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and many others. Our mission is to decentralize social media the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. As a layer-1 blockchain, DeSo can be compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc... However, DeSo has several major advantages over these platforms, the largest being that it is designed to power storage-heavy applications (like social applications and marketplaces). To put it in perspective, storing just a 200-character ""Tweet"" on Ethereum costs ~$80, and costs ~$0.25-$1.00+ on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and virtually all other smart contract chains. In contrast, it costs 1/1,000th of a penny on DeSo, which is why breakthrough apps like Diamond, DAODAO, Pearl, OpenProsper, NFTz, and Entre, now possible exclusively on DeSo. Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin. A handful of private entities effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create. Society’s answer to financial centralization was not to put Warren Buffett in charge of money, it was to use technology, namely Bitcoin, so we could have nobody in charge. We believe the same type of technology will cause this conclusion to ultimately play out in social. DeSo’s advantages make it capable of breaking this status quo for the first time, and bringing competition and innovation back to social in much the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum have done for our financial system.
