Door combines the same principals and culture across residential real estate brokerage, mortgage and title - a team-centric commitment to client service through specialization, full-time non-commissioned experts, and a belief that technology can support and improve the experience and outcomes in home ownership. Our agents and loan officers spend 100% of their time working with clients rather than lead generation. We believe the traditional 100% commission, contractor model does not align with client interests. Our success in delivering the best outcomes in real estate can be independently measured by our Zillow rating of 4.9 out of 5.0.  The Door Difference: Technology as service enabler: We build technology to increase access, transparency and insights for clients in their  real estate journey.  Specialization : The real estate process requires a very wide range of skills, and the only way to manage each component of the process well is to specialize. Door agents & experts specialize in areas like project management,  marketing, lead management, home valuation, transaction coordination and negotiation to ensure each agent is focused on what they do best. This leads to happier agents and much better outcomes for clients. Keep More of their Home Equity : Since our agents focus only on client service (instead of lead generation), they are able to close many more transactions per month than a traditional agent - and with very high client satisfaction scores. That enables Door to charge far less in fees, and for our clients to keep more of their hard-earned equity.

The unexpected physical effect of ferroelectricity in HfO2 allows for the transformation of classical high-k metal-gate (HKMG) transistors into nonvolatile ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFET). In this way, MCUs can easily be scaled from e.g. 65 nm down to 28 nm and beyond enabling tremendous advantages for the overall system: SoC cost reduction of around 80%, per bit write energy reduction by a factor of 1000 and an overall performance gain of the system of around 70% due to the transition to advanced process nodes.

Our Trackwatch technology detects the most advanced threats, made with the most crafted exploitation methods (polymorphism, obfuscation, encoding, ROPchain…) and the threats based on all types of malicious files (ransomware, cryptolocker…). Our platform was made for all types of organizations wishing to be equipped with the most efficient detection tools. Gatewatcher also meets the ANSSI hardening requirements for the Military Planning Act in order to protect all sensitive and strategic organizations. With over two hundred probes deployed worldwide, Gatewatcher offers unrivalled detection capabilities to its customers by analysing the most complex cyberattacks. The project was started in 2015 by engineer, Jacques de La Rivière, and security expert, Philippe Gillet. Gatewatcher’s team is composed of experts in security, networks, systems, encryption and machine learning. During the 2016 edition of the FIC (Forum International Cybersecurity), Gatewatcher was awarded the French Cybersecurity accreditation rewarding innovation in the cyber defence field. It’s also being certified by ANSSI (French Cybersecurity Agency) and meets the requirement of the Military Planning Act. Gatewatcher is based on unique technology in weak signal analysis and machine learning, targeting abnormal behaviours by running a dynamic analysis of weak signals from inside network flows. Gatewatcher is the only product on the market with a dual approach to the threat in the exploration phase, with deep data capture and optimal analysis: it auto-adapts to polymorphic threats, in order to guarantee a strong accuracy. Our technology, Trackwatch, uses four next-generation engines: - Sigflow: formal and statistical analysis, anomaly detection. - Codebreaker: recognises APTs stemming from encoded Shellcodes / ROP (Return Oriented Programming) and JOP (Jump Oriented Programming) - Malcore: real-time heuristic and static multi-engine malware analysis.

The technology, based on research shortlisted for the Lloyd’s Science of Risk Prize 2015, is aimed at addressing the challenges of increasingly anonymous and persistent threats to rapidly-expanding global networks, particularly in the wake of Smart Cities and the Internet of Things. The system raises early warning on network assets for possible undesirable activity, by applying a Bayesian-based framework to systematically analyze indicators associated with early stages of such activity. This approach dramatically reduces the processing overheads of monitoring. The benefits to the security operation include scalability to networks exceeding 1 billion devices, providing earlier visibility of risk and improving prioritization and decision-making in deploying countermeasures.  CyberOwl is developing its minimum viable product and is looking for two or three strategic industry design partners for validation, verification, and further development.

Dr Lipov, the Chief Medical Officer at Stella, is credited with innovating the Stellate Ganglion Block (""SGB"") as an intervention for trauma symptoms. After experiencing trauma, the way our brain functions may change in dramatic ways. In some cases, we become stuck in “fight or flight” mode - which can be observed in certain types of brain scans. It may be helpful to think about the sympathetic nervous system as being somewhat like an engine. Under normal conditions, we are in “neutral gear,” a relatively relaxed state not associated with feeling threatened. However, extreme stressors can shift and lock us into a higher gear, where we may remain for years or even decades. This state may involve “feeling constantly revved up and being unable to throttle down.” Common indicators of this altered biological state include symptoms like disrupted sleep, anger attacks, overwhelming panic, difficulties concentrating, a feeling of constantly being on “high alert”, and a strong startle response - in other words, the “hyper-arousal” cluster of post trauma symptoms. Stella’s adaptation of SGB involves injecting a widely available, commonly used anesthesia into a bundle of nerves in the neck, just above the collarbone. The injected medication has the short-term effect of soothing and “re-setting” the overactive nerves, operating in the same temporary way as the Novocaine administered by a dentist. To return to the earlier analogy, SGB seems to manually pop a “stuck gear” back into “neutral.”",https://www.facebook.com/StellaTraumaCare/,"Greater Chicago Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health Care,3,"Eugene Lipov, Michael Gershenzon, Stefan Weitz",11-50,1,,2023-05-09,7000000,USD,7000000,Venture - Series Unknown,7000000,USD,7000000,Venture - Series Unknown,7000000,USD,7000000,7000000,USD,7000000,Sterling Partners,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-25.68%,88,,,,0,2,,Medical services; veterinary services,,,

This has contributed to drug development failure by diluting true responders in a population of patients with heterogeneous biology. STALICLA’s technology platform, DEPI, discovers biologically based endophenotypes within classical neuropsychiatric diagnostic groups. The AI/ML engine converges molecular data with human genetic information and non-behavioral clinical signs and symptoms, to define biologically related subgroups and create testable clinical hypotheses related to that biology. The DEPI platform has already completed several successful clinical validations, through the identification and biological validation of two distinct subgroups of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD-Phenotype1 and ASD-Phenotype2, together with their predicted tailored treatment candidates (STP1 and STP2); as well as the blindly and retrospective calling “high” responder patients to previously failed drug candidates with high specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value. Further the completion of STP1 Phase 1b in 2022, STP1 will enter clinical Phase 2 in 2023; as well as STP2, a Phase 2 ready asset in licensed in Q4 ’22. Additionally, STALICLA will be advancing STP7, a recently in-licensed Phase 3 ready asset from Novartis, with strong potential for a neuropsychiatric indication, and whose clinical development will be fully financed by a non-dilutive funding to be announced in Feb. STALICLA is currently preparing its next stage of growth, to advance its pipelines and to scale its platform towards revenue generation.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",1,Lynn Durham,11-50,6,Seed,2022-12-01,4150000,CHF,4431492,Convertible Note,500000,EUR,563859,Seed,21870575,USD,21870575,36059379,USD,36059379,"LIFTT, AA Sons",1,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24,,,,13,2,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,"Pharmaceutical, veterinary and sanitary products",,,
