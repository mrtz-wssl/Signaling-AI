The patented SAG™ Methods and SAGScore™ trust score for app stores (US 11374961) and Software Assurance Guardian™ (SAG™) Point Man™  (SAG-PM™) software supply chain risk assessment application has continued to evolve and improve, and now stands at version 1.2, with support for both SPDX and CycloneDX SBOM formats. SAG-PM™ has been developed to help protect small and medium sized companies from malicious software objects and untrustworthy parties that may have compromised the integrity of a software supply chain, preventing the installation of bad, harmful software, i.e. ransomware, into an operational system.  REA has become the de-facto testing partner for the NTIA SBOM community, serving in the role of a software consumer for SBOM interoperability testing with numerous software vendors. REA is an IEEE Entrepreneurship Program Member and an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Activate Company.  REA is an active Member of the DHS CISA Critical Manufacturing Sector Coordinating Council (CMSCC), DHS CISA ICT_SCRM Task Force, Software Assurance Work Group developing tools to help small and medium businesses secure their software supply chains and prevent the installation of ransomware and other malware and the IETF Supply Chain Integrity Transparency and Trust (SCITT) work group. Never trust software, always verify and report!™ SAG-PM™performs a patented (US 111374961) software supply chain risk assessment process containing seven critical investigative steps on a software object's installation file as part of a comprehensive software supply chain risk assessment process that calculates a SAGScore™, indicating a level of Trustworthiness for the software object itself and parties serving roles within the software supply chain. A SAGScore™  is conceptually similar to a FICO Score, but for software trustworthiness of a software object to perform as expected. When applied to apps on app stores the SAGScore™ gives a software consumer visibility into the trustworthiness of each app, which can help consumers decide which app to install from a set of search results, based on the highest SAGScore™. These seven steps implement best practices to augment NERC CIP-010-3 software verification standards by applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework V1.1 and the NTIA Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standards recognized by the Department of Commerce NTIA SBOM initiative. The May 12, 2021 Cybersecurity Executive Order, 14028, mandates that Federal Agencies and Departments require all software vendors of critical software to provide SBOM's as part of their software product distributions. An SBOM will enable Federal buyers of software products to conduct a software risk assessment, using SAG-PM™, to determine the trustworthiness of a software package, prior to installation. This ""proactive"" risk assessment can detect harmful malware, such a ransomware and other nefarious software, preventing it from being installed in a digital ecosystem, where it can cause damages.  An AWS cloud based SAGServer™ provides database and other support services to the SAG-PM™ software application, including a List of Trusted Software Objects in the SAG-CTR™ Community Trust Registry along with their SAGScore™, that have been digitally signed, which the SAG-PM™ user community has identified as trustworthy. Software products that receive multiple trust registrations from the SAG-PM™ end user community can receive the SAG-STAR™ label to indicate their high level achievement of trustworthiness. The new SEC cybersecurity rules are placing more responsibility, and liability for cybersecurity controls/protections on Officers and Directors. The SAG-CTR includes a ""Secure Evidence Locker"" where tamper-proof evidence of proactive cybersecurity controls to monitor for CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability (KEV) risks in software assets is stored to aid Officers and Directors in mounting a defense against any shareholder lawsuits, in the event of a cyber-incident, that must be report within 96 hours under the SEC Cybersecurity rules that go into effect December 2023. The SAG user documentation also includes an appendix containing a description of processes, policies and practices for cyber-risk detection and risk management in the software Supply Chain, i.e., CISA KEV's,needed for disclosure to the SEC, starting in December 2023. REA has open-sourced its, free to use, Vendor Response File Format and Vulnerability Disclosure Report XML schemas to help software vendors and consumers exchange critical information required to meet Executive Order 14028 and the new ""SBOM Bill"" making its way through Congress, H.R. 4611; A sample use case showing all required evidence data for a comprehensive risk assessment is available online at:  https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/tree/master/C-SCRM-Use-Case   open source XML VRF and NIST Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) schemas are available here:  https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products  REA is a proud member of the IEEE Entrepreneurship program and an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Activate partner.

It is the only company globally working on technology enabling a gradual implementation of Hyperloop-inspired solutions as an upgrade for the railway industry. The company has developed a unique, patent-pending magrail technology, which allows modernizing existing conventional railway lines to a standard of passive magnetic railways, reaching speed of  300 kph (186 mph) on normal lines and 415 kph (258 mph) on HSR lines. The magrail system allows keeping the functionality of conventional railways on a modernized line (railway operators can depreciate their existing rolling stock). Magrail can be subsequently transformed into a vacuum system – hyperrail, reaching speed of 600 kph (373 mph) on normal lines and 1000 kph (621 mph) on HSR lines. The third generation is hyperloop – vacuum magnetic railways built within new transportation corridors for top speed of 1200 kph (746 mph), using subsystems tested in the first two generations. Capex for retrofitting railway infrastructure to a magrail standard are estimated to ca. EUR 6-8 million per km, which is comparable to the cost of building a new highway and up to 60-70% lower than the average cost of building a new HSR line in the EU. Energy costs will be lower by ca. 13% for the speed of 300 kph (186 mph) compared to HSR, whole for the speed of 415 kph (258 mph) magrail needs the same amount of energy than HSR currently for 300 kph (186 mph). The maintenance costs will be ca. 25% lower than for HSR, due to elimination of friction of mechanical elements at high speeds. The company was founded in 2017 and until mid-2019 it submitted 8 patent applications. In the first half of 2019 it secured an EUR 3.8 million grant in Poland and raised EUR 334 thousands during the first Polish equity crowdfunding campaign on a UK-based platform Seedrs.  Currently a Proof of Concept (PoC) is almost completed (ca. 50 m. long test track, which will be demonstrated in Q4.2019)., while at the turn of 2020 and 2021 a demonstration of the first full-scale prototype is planned. Corporate partners include TME Transfer Multisort Electronics and Microsoft. Key member of the R&D team is prof. Jacek F Gieras who has conducted research on Shinkansen SCMaglev at the Central Japan Railway Company. The company has got an international Advisory Board, including: Dorota Raben - expert in logistics & the former President of the Board of the Maritime Port of Gdansk SA, Amos Ron- former Director General at the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in Israel, and Vladas Lašas (also an early investor in Hyper Poland) who has co-founded Carbon War room together with Sir Richard Branson.",https://www.facebook.com/Nevomo.tech,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hardware, Transportation",4,"Katarzyna Foljanty, Paweł Radziszewski, Przemek Paczek, Łukasz Mielczarek",11-50,10,,2022-11-02,5000000,EUR,4906949,Convertible Note,1229340,EUR,1501946,Equity Crowdfunding,2751171,USD,2751171,14730243,USD,14730243,"EIT InnoEnergy, MassChallenge, European Innovation Council, Seedrs, National Center for Research & Development",3,7,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,-58.92%,37,,,,6,1,Vehicles In General,Common metals and their alloys; ores,31496543,USD,31496543

The software deploys the power of data science and progressive machine intelligence to simplify end-to-end logistics and gain transparency in business.  Cloud-based, our easy-to-use software is quick to set up, can be rapidly extended across organizations and is simple to integrate with existing systems. Through innovative solutions, GoComet automates freight rate negotiations, tracks shipments in real-time, automates invoice reconciliation, makes audits seamless and offers unique insights through auto-generated reports.  Product list and features: GoComet RFQ management: The RFQ management module automates your freight rate negotiation and allows you to create and share inquiries with all your vendors simultaneously.  RFQs can be created and submitted to vendors in seconds, who can then submit their quotes and see their rank compared to their competitors but crucially, not their price or identity.  Through compound negotiation via vendors’ efforts to secure the first rank and increase their chance of winning business, the rate you pay keeps shrinking, ensuring that by the end of the bidding process you can win the best deal at the best price.  The module also offers the option of power negotiation through which you can give your vendors a target rate to further squeeze the rates. The system enables you to win the best rates in both spot rates and contract-based shipments.  Features:  Saves money: By deploying the power Recursive Rate Reduction system the module helps you achieve 8-15% cost savings in your freight procurement process.  Saves time: The module reduces the time taken to create and share RFQ to less than 12 minutes per quote as against the traditional way that takes about 45 minutes per RFQ. The system makes this possible as it automates the process and saves the shipper from the hassle of creating several quote comparison sheets, manually following up with vendors in case they fail to provide certain information in the quote, etc. Fully automates freight rate negotiation: The module eliminates the need to call and exchange countless emails with your vendors to get quotes and negotiate rates for every single shipment.  Instant Quote Comparison Sheet (QCS): The system allows you to create a QCS within a click and highlights the best deal, saving your team the trouble of compiling data, manually creating quote comparison sheets and figuring out the best deal.   Eliminates the scope for errors: As the system automates the entire process of RFQs, the scope for human error gets eliminated. Improves communication with vendors: The module helps you improve your relationship with vendors as all the communication happens on a single platform and minimises the scope for any confusion or mistakes.  Audit trail: An audit trail of all shipments gets created as the confirmation of each vendor is captured on the platform itself. This leads to an increased level of transparency. Unlimited vendors: As the system automates the RFQ management process, you can potentially invite quotes from unlimited vendors as against the traditional system where the number of vendors is restricted due to several limitations. GoComet Shipment Tracking: GoComet’s shipment tracking module provides a single dashboard to give you real-time, automated updates on the movement of all your international shipments.  With increased visibility on the movement of your goods and the service levels of your carriers, your team is equipped to make informed, data-driven decisions despite uncertainties.  What’s more, tracking data can also be shared with your customers for their shipments, providing them detailed updates about orders throughout the lead time and improving their customer experiences via unprecedented transparency. Features: Unified tracking dashboard: The system will give you automated and real-time notifications about shipment milestones, arrival, delays and unforeseen events on a single dashboard. Moreover, it allows tracking of couriers, ocean and air freight.   Customer delight: You can share the dashboard with your consignees to enhance your service and improve customer relationships.  Actionable insights: The module offers actionable insights on shipping lines, volumes and country-wise logistics performance.  Integrable with ERP: You can integrate the tracking mechanism with your existing ERP. GoComet Freight Index (GFI): The GoComet Freight Index module makes it possible to benchmark freight rates for major ports across the world.  The module pools in data from over 25,000 quotes that are submitted on the GoComet platform every month. The system considers the top-rated and lowest quoting 10 vendors on each route and runs its machine learning algorithms to determine the GFI. The algorithms are based on those used by the World Container Freight Index and Shanghai Freight Index. Features: Benchmark rates: The module allows you to benchmark rates for every route by comparing them to the market rates suggested by the GFI. Find true market rates: You can figure out the true market rates for both 20’ and 40’ containers with the help of GFI. Market rate trends: Stay updated with the latest market rates in the international shipping industry. Invoice reconciliation module: Industry studies reveal that invoice processing costs around $5 to $12 per invoice. Worst yet, the process is mundane, time-consuming and prone to errors.  GoComet’s automatic invoice reconciliation module helps you reduce these inefficiencies by 76% and saves 80% of the time taken to match invoices. The software matches your freight invoices to your original contracts and immediately highlights any inconsistencies to your vendor, saving you the trouble to follow up with them in person each and every time there is an error.  The system can even auto-approve invoices and notify your payments team, making the process faster and more efficient and reducing payment times to your vendors. Features: Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Inconsistencies between the invoice and your original quotation are highlighted through a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, contextual language processing and algorithmic programming. Saves time: Saves 76% of the time spent on manually processing and matching invoices. Reduces workload: The system reduces the workload of your logistics and accounts team and eliminates the scope for any errors by auto-rejecting duplicate invoices uploaded by Logistics Service Providers. Automates approvals: The module offers you the option to auto-approve invoices that are up to the mark. Better audits: Improved auditing process via the ability to time-stamp remarks and comments on each invoice. Improved relationship with vendors: Improved client-vendor relationship due to better payment cycles and full transparency. Port delay portal: GoComet port delay online portal provides free, daily and real-time information on the average and maximum delays at seaports across the world. The system pools data from the thousands of containers that GoComet tracks each and every day through our container tracking software. Regularly updated, the portal maintains a record of port delays across more than 300 ports. Features: Convenience: Convenience and ease of functionality were our key objectives when engineering the product and the result is the most user-friendly platform in the market today. Instant information: To find information on any port of your choice, simply enter its name in the search field on the port delay portal. The module will then instantly display the average and maximum delay for that port. Colour-coded: To enhance user-experience, delay classifications have also been colour-coded.",https://www.facebook.com/gocomet.in,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Software, Transportation",4,"Ayush Lodhi, Chitransh Sahai, Gautam Prem Jain, Mehul Katiyar",101-250,3,Early Stage Venture,2022-02-08,7000000,USD,7000000,Series A,7000000,USD,7000000,Series A,9500000,USD,9500000,9500000,USD,9500000,"Atlas Ventures, India Quotient, Leo Capital, SGInnovate, Rebright Partners",6,12,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-53.14%,11,,,22,,,,,,,

These factor Xa coagulants are taken by millions of patients world-wide for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and stroke, but as a side effect severe bleeding often occurs.
