The company enables those vehicles to understand what people might do next so they can navigate safely and smoothly around humans, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers. The level of understanding of our human-like AI goes well beyond what standard physics-based approaches can deliver, including information that can’t be gained any other way. Importantly, in addition to increased safety, we enable a much more natural and smooth human-like driving of L4/5 autonomous vehicles. This is essential for autonomous vehicles to be accepted into a human-dominated road environment and also by passengers of robotaxi services. Without this capability autonomous vehicles simply will not function well enough.

Our patented technology enables us to provide solutions that get installed in the top of fire trucks and public safety vehicles, so that when e.g. a firefighter shows up to their scene, they push a single button, and their Fotokite system opens up, deploys itself, and flies up to 45 meters in height to provide the first responders with mission-critical information about their scene. From up there, we provide both thermal and regular video down to the ground to give teams visibility and elevated intelligence over their scene. The information delivered helps them size up and assess their incidents quickly and without drawing additional team resources like normal drones. We actively use a tether to provide power up the line and data down the line to deliver a fully autonomous, situational awareness system with 24-hour-plus flight times. The real benefit to the user is the fact that they gain this information without ever piloting the system- it’s as simple as it gets. They simply push “launch” on a tablet, set their altitude and camera angle, and the system takes care of the rest.  Once up in the air, the system is also set up to live stream that aerial information to other teams on the same site, or back at the fire station to provide more eyes on the scene than were possible before. They use this information to gain perspective and context of their incident, and then deploy their resources in a more data-informed way.",https://www.facebook.com/fotokite,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content and Publishing, Government and Military, Hardware, Internet Services, Manufacturing, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software, Video",1,Sergei Lupashin,11-50,12,Early Stage Venture,2022-01-19,13700000,CHF,14958961,Series B,13700000,CHF,14958961,Series B,21453873,USD,21453873,25635390,USD,25635390,"Techstars, Credit Suisse, Qualcomm Ventures, EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs, SICTIC",3,11,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-13.02%,73,1,,18,2,0,Aircraft; Aviation; Cosmonautics,,,,

Making decentralized leverage a reality thanks to Credit Account abstraction! Gearbox Protocol uses Credit Account abstraction to bring together lending and prime brokerage in the same protocol. Lenders deposit assets to earn passive yield, while the composable leverage side users borrow these assets to create spot leverage positions, which can be used across DeFi.
