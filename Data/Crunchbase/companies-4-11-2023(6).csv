RELO micro-factories produce fresher, greener, and more affordable packaged foods and beverages. They co-locate food production, packaging, and distribution in close proximity to distribution centers to achieve localized fulfillment. By eliminating unnecessary upstream trucking from production plants to retailers, the RELO system effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions, operating costs, and supply chain risks. Transporting products made primarily of water on trucks comes at a huge economic and environmental cost. 20% of the GHG footprint of food comes from transportation according to Nature Sustainability, much of it from middle mile trucking. While the majority focuses on replacing their traditional trucking fleets with electric vehicles, we are questioning the fundamental design of centralized food supply chains by pioneering a distributed, hyper-local food production system, with the aim of completely eliminating trucks and the chain. Recently, Relocalize made a groundbreaking achievement, launching the world's first autonomous food & beverage micro-factory in collaboration with Southeastern Grocers in Florida. The RELO system produces packaged ice hyper-locally on-demand, effectively eliminating 100% of upstream logistics and transportation.

Enhanced rock weathering is a nature-enabled technology that permanently locks away carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The geological process of weathering has happened naturally for millions of years, removing billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide over Earth's history. UNDO accelerates this natural process by spreading crushed rock with a high reactive surface area onto agricultural land, where plants and microbes in the soil speed up the weathering process. The breakdown of the rock by carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater releases nutrients and bicarbonates, which end up in the oceans as solid carbonate minerals, permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.    Part of Stripe’s 2021 Climate Portfolio, UNDO is scaling operations in the UK and US. The rock, a by-product of the aggregate and mining industry, is given to local farmers for free and applied on agricultural land using existing infrastructure. In addition to permanent, rapid and scalable carbon removals, UNDO’s holistic partnership model delivers significant co-benefits such as improved soil health, ocean deacidification and increased profits for farming communities.",https://www.facebook.com/undocarbon,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Natural Resources, Professional Services",1,Jim Mann,51-100,1,,2023-05-22,9600000,GBP,11936586,Venture - Series Unknown,9600000,GBP,11936586,Venture - Series Unknown,9600000,GBP,11936587,9600000,GBP,11936587,"Lowercarbon Capital, AENU",2,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56.15%,11,,,,8,1,Computing; Calculating,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

Its founders, Rishi Khosla and Joel Perlman, had experienced this first-hand while scaling their previous company - Copal. In 2015, three years after launching that business, they applied for a bank loan and the ‘computer said ‘no’’, despite their business being profitable. The products, services, and experience needed to make their lives as a scaling business easier, and enable them to reach their full potential, were ‘missing’ from banks’ offerings. As entrepreneurs, their response was to build what was missing: a neobank for entrepreneurs, by entrepreneurs. To date, its bespoke debt finance solutions have supported property developers, care homes, specialist schools and nurseries, hotels, bars and restaurants, pub operators, as well as fund and specialist finance providers. With a range of specialist secured and unsecured business loans, OakNorth caters to the growth plans of businesses, without asking them to give up equity. Despite experiencing not one, but two unprecedented events – Brexit and COVID-19 – since its launch, the bank has continued supporting growth businesses across the UK. It’s lent over £10 billion to date, directly helping with the creation of almost tens of thousands of new jobs and new homes (the significant majority of which are affordable and social housing). Its data-led approach allows it to look at the future, rather than just fixating on the past, meaning it avoids making decisions based on outdated financials. Using data and analytics, it builds up a granular view of every business in its portfolio, combining this with forward-looking scenario analysis, to enable it to be a trusted funding partner as the business scales, and continue confidently lending through economic cycles and unprecedented events. By behaving as reliable, long-term partners to its customers throughout the pandemic, rather than just bankers, it has been able to make them its best advocates. As a result, c.80% of its new lending comes via referrals, and 40% of its borrowers are repeat customers.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,8,8,7,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Joel Perlman, Rishi Khosla",501-1000,9,Private Equity,2021-06-02,,,,Non-equity Assistance,440000000,USD,440000000,Private Equity,1041034147,USD,1041034147,1041034147,USD,1041034147,"GIC, Indiabulls Housing Finance, EDBI, SoftBank Vision Fund, Clermont Group",7,10,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2020-11-11,,1,-29.92%,38,,,,0,9,,Insurance; financial affairs,,,

This infrastructure will resolve the problem of intermittent connectivity for non-geostationary satellites, will open new business opportunities that necessitate real-time connectivity to satellites, and will reduce reliance on costly and difficult to deploy ground infrastructure. The company is currently developing technologies and delivering services that solved terrestrial connectivity needs, offering terrestrial wideband and soon-to-be narrowband connectivity services for IoT applications. With Kepler's first service, named Global Data ServiceTM, they have been able to pack more Mbps into a nanosatellite than anybody else ever before. This wideband service delivers a store-and-forward type of solution for companies needing to move large quantities of delay-tolerant data from regions where connectivity is limited or non-existent. It is designed to transfer 100s of GBs of data monthly between remote locations and company headquarters or the internet. This service is available today for trials. Kepler is also developing a satellite service for Internet of Things devices – called everywhereIoTTM. A low-power, low-cost, bi-directional narrowband satellite service that will allow to connect assets all around the globe (at sea, land and even in the poles).
