The core mission is the development of novel, value-add solutions for insurers surrounding the prediction, treatment, payment, and adjudication of claims involving bodily injuries. We are relentlessly focused on bringing innovation to the bodily injury arena in a fashion similar to those who have brought innovations to address damage to the vehicle before us. The foundation of the Talem platform was built to analyze photos of vehicles post-accident and deliver predictions related to the impact, forces, and damage to the human body ‚Äì rather than the vehicle. This foundation and additional feature set are specifically designed to materially impact key areas of the claim lifecycle through a data-driven focus on injury causation and the recovery of an injured party.  What we have learned throughout our journey is that insurers do not have a solid grasp of injuries until late in the claim lifecycle. This reactive approach to bodily injury management opens opportunities for the increased claim and operational costs, a growing number of open claims, and a higher likelihood of undetected fraud. Talem's approach provides a fundamental shift to earlier, more proactive management and data-driven insights which has proven to be successful. We have demonstrated up to a 90% reduction of service referral time, 50% reduction of adjuster handle time for medical bill processes, greater than 500k annual handle time savings, and an indication of 50% savings on services with a Talem subscription vs traditional transactional approach.  To execute on our vision we have assembled a team of experts in injury science, technology, and insurance operations. Our team members have, on average, twenty years of experience in the management of automotive injuries, medical claims management, end-to-end insurance services and operations, occupant kinematics, injury causation and rehabilitation, and highly sophisticated data & analytics tools and methods.

Innovation is what drives us; it glues us and our customers. Over the years, we have worked with many large enterprises across different industries to help them build better customer interactions. Soon we realized the cost of adapting these technologies were too high. This created a big and unnecessary barrier for most organizations to benefit from that. Additionally, it became obvious to us that people were forced to interact with machines in a machine-way (point and click), not a human way (write, speak). This has shaped our vision, mission and our product set. Today, our increasingly digital, always-on world is transforming the way companies function on a daily basis. People now have the ability to control who they interact with, when, and how. So, we‚Äôre creating a world where businesses can stay constantly connected to their customers, their way.

It is a comprehensive solution that significantly reduces the cost of entry into the blockchain, Web3, and Defi market by providing data in a way that is familiar to developers that have not yet found themselves interacting with the world of blockchain technology.  For projects that already have experience in extracting and analyzing blockchain data, it  provides access to a quick and costless way of gathering that data, allowing them to focus on solving business problems rather than working on the supporting infrastructure, which tends to consume a lot of project resources and delay the implementation of core functions.  It‚Äôs crucial to note that the API-Verse allows access to not only real-time data but also historical data, making it very easy to spot trends, bottoms, peaks, cyclic movements and other community behaviors that would otherwise require a heavy amount of research to outline.   Our API-Verse consists of several interconnected solutions that together provide multiple comprehensive solutions to common and uncommon business problems. These solutions are a combination of a JSON-RPC API (own nodes), storage analysers, blockchain indexers, front-end SDK, a relayer mechanism, and a validator.  The indexer allows you to access and analyze on-chain data that was previously only available in a difficult-to-access way (or sometimes even impossible to obtain) and directly answer business questions and needs. The combination of the indexer and relayer allows not only to effectively detect abnormal behaviours but also to react quickly if those behaviours aren‚Äôt in line with your project guidelines, meaning that the analysis of the data won‚Äôt only provide you with new business opportunities, it will also potentially protect against malicious attacks from third parties, or, more commonly, from bots. The relayer also allows to automate the execution of cyclic activities that previously required either manual execution or the private key storage of the activity followed by the need of performing operations directly from the application backend.  In conclusion, API-Verse is a comprehensive platform that provides a cost-effective and straightforward solution for businesses looking to enter the blockchain market. With its powerful range of solutions, businesses can easily access real-time and historical blockchain data, detect abnormal behaviors, and automate cyclic activities. These features make API-Verse an essential tool for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge in the blockchain market.",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Information Technology, Other, Software",2,"Michal Domarecki, Wojciech Litwin",11-50,1,Seed,2022-10-01,250000,USD,250000,Pre-Seed,250000,USD,250000,Pre-Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,0,1,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,

Using their proprietary adenovirus platform, GM is developing several pipeline products that can be intratumorally and intravenously administered to selectively attack and eradicate tumor cells as well as potently stimulating multiple arms of antitumor immune response. GM‚Äôs viral immunotherapy has proven effective as both a standalone therapy and in combination with current standard of care, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Intratumoral administration of GM oncolytic adenovirus offers several advantages over competitor products; (1) higher level of virus accumulation and localization in tumor tissues and (2) lower off-target systemic exposure, ultimately exerting potent therapeutic effect with minimal systemic toxicity. Our pipeline can effectively treat wide range of tumor types, including breast cancers (triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive), prostate cancer, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, desmoplastic cancers (like pancreatic cancer), and injectable visceral tumors that have spread to the liver, such as metastases from colorectal and lung cancer. To treat metastatic and recurrent cancers in late-stage cancer patients, GM has developed systemic delivery platform for oncolytic viruses that avoids rapid blood clearance and inactivation by the immune system and various blood components, which are known to severely hamper the clinical effectiveness of intravenously administered viral immunotherapies. Systemic delivery represents an important next step in successful oncolytic virus treatments for intractable and metastatic cancers that have disseminated to multiple organs.  Headquartered in the Fusion Technology Center, Seoul, South Korea, GM is a leader in oncolytic immunotherapy. GM‚Äôs potent multi-armed oncolytic viral platform (GM-OAd) is a culmination of multiple proprietary oncolytic adenovirus technologies, which has been intelligently designed and carefully optimized to ensure maximum therapeutic benefit in patients. The company was founded in 2014 and has been the recipient of Korean venture backing and grants. GM-OAd is a proprietary oncolytic adenovirus that has been extensively engineered to maximize its safety, cancer selectivity, and anti-tumor activity. GM-OAd-mediated oncolysis results in immunogenic cell death to trigger robust antitumor immune activation and memory formation to ensure long-term therapeutic benefit against cancer. GM has a highly scalable, low cost manufacturable platform offering highly versatile, innovative treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic tumors. Further, they have a deep portfolio of unique, globally protected, intellectual property including patents for systemic delivery platform for oncolytic virus and technologies that ensure effective degradation of tumor extracellular matrix to enhance the intratumoral permeation and distribution of other conventional cancer drugs, like chemotherapy, targeted antibodies, and ICI, to achieve strong synergistic potential.

Buildings consume 40% of energy and contribute to 30% of carbon emissions globally. Building Owners can save 30% to 40% in operating costs through proven green retrofit measures with an average IRR > 25%. IEA quantifies the green building market at $150 bn currently and the cumulative spend on building retrofits will exceed 7.2tn by 2040. However, building industry players do not have the tools to easily identify and quantify energy saving opportunities, evaluate  the latest technological solutions and access financing options. The lack of a unified data platform inhibits the growth of the industry. This in turn severely prohibits timely deployment of successful decarbonization strategies. BtrLyf is a unified green building market platform that helps accelerate sustainable development through digital co-creation. Our AI-enabled collaborative building simulation engine has been developed through several years of R&D with support from Singapore government grants. The platform aggregates multiple sources of data, including open source, API linked, and user entered data for ML processing and analytics. The resultant impact includes reduced transaction time, low marketing costs, shorter sales cycles, lower investment risk and improved productivity of business process by up to 10x.

Fortune Bay Corp. (‚ÄúFortune Bay‚Äù) was formed through a series of public transactions that have been spearheaded by Fortune Bay‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer, Wade Dawe. Linear Resources Inc.  was formed pursuant to articles of amendment dated October 6, 1999, and Mr. Dawe was appointed to its Board of Directors.   In 2003, Mr. Dawe assumed the role of President and CEO,  and the company then changed its name to Linear Gold Corp. (‚ÄúLinear Gold‚Äù or ""Linear"") and focused on gold exploration in the Americas.   Later in 2003, Linear raised initial equity financing of CDN$7.3 million and subsequently acquired a number of gold assets in Central America from Switzerland based Xstrata PLC.  As part of the transaction with Xstrata, the Ixhuat√°n property, located in Chiapas, Mexico, was acquired.  Exploration activity at the Ixhuat√°n property from 2004 to 2007 by Linear resulted in a significant +1.7 million ounce gold discovery.  From 2003 through 2009, Linear Gold raised in excess of CDN$75 million from the capital markets to fund its exploration activities.   On August 20, 2009, Linear, through a wholly owned subsidiary, purchased the Goldfields Property for US$5,000,000 in cash, the assumption of certain liabilities and the issuance of 727,272 common shares of Linear.  The Goldfields property hosts a +1.0 million ounce gold deposit.   On June 25, 2010, Linear amalgamated with Apollo Gold Corporation to form a new company Brigus Gold Corp. (‚ÄúBrigus‚Äù), and Wade Dawe was appointed Chief Executive Officer.   Post-merger Brigus operated the Black Fox gold mine in Ontario, Canada, while advancing its gold deposits in Mexico and Saskatchewan, Canada.   The company employed approximately 400 people and traded on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.     On March 5, 2014, Primero Mining Corp (‚ÄúPrimero‚Äù) acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brigus by way of a court approved plan of arrangement for an enterprise value of CDN$351 million. Pursuant to the arrangement, Primero acquired Brigus‚Äô Black Fox mine and surrounding properties in Ontario, Canada.   In addition to the acquisition by Primero, the transaction involved Brigus spinning out certain assets to form a new TSX listed company, Fortune Bay Corp. Assets spun out to Fortune Bay included the Goldfields Project in Saskatchewan, Canada, the Ixhuat√°n Project in Chiapas, Mexico, and several properties in the Dominican Republic, along with cash of CDN$10 million.    The properties located in the Dominican Republic were subsequently sold by Fortune Bay on March 19, 2014.     On June 27, 2016, Fortune Bay Corp. completed a transaction pursuant to which it acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ireland based software developer Kneat Solutions Limited.   The corporation subsequently changed its name to ""kneat.com, inc.""  and listed on the TSX-V with the trading symbol KSI. As part of the transaction, Fortune Bay Corp. spun-out its gold resource properties by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement in Ontario; and formed a new gold-focused corporation to hold the Goldfields project and the Ixhuat√°n project which changed it‚Äôs name to ‚ÄòFortune Bay Corp.‚Äô  The new Fortune Bay Corp., second company to have this name, currently trades on the TSX-V with the symbol FOR.

We allow listeners to pick one song per day that they believe could become a future hit. In addition, we track all listener behavior (skips, plays, upvotes, downvotes, etc.) internally and sign the best songs based on these metrics to exclusive publishing deals with our partner Spirit Music Group, starting to monetize those songs by placing them in film, TV, ads and other royalty generating media. Music lovers who placed their bets on the right song will own a token of that song, generating royalties alongside every other stakeholder in the song or being able to trade and sell the token via marketplaces.  Artists who don't have a professional recording of their songs can utilize our online recording studio to record their music with some of the best session musicians in the world at studio quality at a low cost.
