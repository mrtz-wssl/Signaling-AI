The work team includes both systems and communication professionals. The company’s experience with UX/IU, identity creation and handling AI algorithms allowed them to develop unique and flexible solution that can be adapted to the requirements of large or small companies. The system tracks start time, end time and breaks for working team members during the working day. It consists of a mobile application and a dashboard. When a person clocks in, the mobile application starts tracking the location and takes a selfie to verify the user’s ID. During the day, it records both the working time and the locations and itineraries until the user stops it by either taking a break or clocking out. Also can be implemented as a cloud service and provides agile management of working hours and time-off or vacation requests by personnel, and the days worked may be viewed on the dashboard or the mobile application. The mobile application can be used to send notifications to all personnel easily and directly and to set up and maintain a fluid communication channel between individuals and Human Resources. Fichap can be installed in tablets at fixed points to clock in and out by using facial recognition if geo-localization is not required. The system is in constant evolution and will soon add other features such as a hierarchy system, a gamification system with scores and benefits/incentives, frequent points and route enhancements. IMPORTANT: With the enactment of Royal Decree-Law 8/2019, in Spain, which establishes the obligation to register workers' days that forces companies to record the work time of their employees, the company decides to look for commercial agents and partners that can implement this system, both in Spain and in the rest of the European countries and Latin America. This solution can be offered both to SMEs and large companies. The system includes security measures for personal data storage, processing and transmission. It does not require any special hardware for operation and relies on the features of mobile devices to manage working hours. It incorporates artificial intelligence.  Competing products only focus on time control, disregarding user experience and the experience of employees, volunteers or member of the organization implementing the system.

The volume of mobile data traffic is exploding and 5G will have to fulfill a growing variety of performance requirements, ranging from extreme mobile broadband to low-latency automotive IoT. To accommodate such demands, enhanced flexibility in managing the infrastructure is needed. Network slicing allows operators to customize resources on a per-service basis, by virtually partitioning the physical infrastructure, thereby enabling new lucrative revenue streams. However, without deep intelligence into the traffic flowing over slices, and where it originates, it is impossible to effectively and efficiently monetize them.  To address this need, our Microscope software uses AI to perform mobile traffic decomposition. Microscope identifies and quantifies the nature and source of individual streams (e.g. Netflix, Google cloud services, Facebook, etc; down to individual base station) from aggregate streams. This allows data to be collected in the cloud rather than from expensive location-based probes, and also works with encrypted data sources which are impossible to analyze with traditional approaches such as using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).  Our technology tackles the challenges of decomposition through deep learning, due to its effectiveness in operating on large-scale mobile traffic in real-time, as demonstrated by our own research. Microscope is fast, cheap, encryption agnostic, scalable, and compatible with current NFV and open RAN initiatives",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Marco Fiore, Mark Chapman, Paul Patras",11-50,1,Seed,2021-11-16,750000,GBP,1006778,Pre-Seed,750000,GBP,1006778,Pre-Seed,750000,GBP,1006779,750000,GBP,1006779,"Techstart Ventures, Creator Fund, Nauta Capital, Old College Capital, Edinburgh Technology Fund",1,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,4,,,,,,,,,,

Also, NFTs make it possible for you to receive a percentage every time your work is sold or changes hands, so you are guaranteed a percentage of the profit if the work gains popularity and increases in price, not to mention, it’s just cool! NIFTY Souq is committed to ZERO minting costs for all artists launching NFTs on the platform, in addition to dedicated onboarding support to bring your NFT vision to life. With ZERO minting costs, artists can price their NFTs affordably, granting them access to more fans. Who we are At NIFTY Souq, we’re excited to be bringing a brand-new type of digital goods to the MENA region through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital files, which are provably scarce and useable across multiple applications. Like physical goods, you can do whatever you want with them! You can collect them, gift them, sell them, and even destroy them! They are digital files that are armed with all the programmable securities to allow them to become digital assets. A core part of our vision is to bring NFT and its technology to the MENA region to where users truly own this powerful brand of new digital items. Open, liquid marketplaces will help power these new economies and support artists to monetize through NFTs and digital assets. Therefore, we are working with a community of passionate users, developers, and creators to build the MENA’s first marketplace for NFTs.

India is a country of stories and storytellers. Traditionally our mythological stories have propagated through oral communication. With mobile phones taking over our day to day conversations that tradition is disappearing faster than we can Imagine. With Sutradhar our objective is to give these storytellers a platform to tell mythological stories from their local tradition and culture to a wide audience through mobile phones. The larger objective is to make Indian Mythology and Cultural Traditions mainstream once again by giving easy access to stories behind those traditions.,https://www.facebook.com/mysutradhar/,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Media and Entertainment, Video",2,"Gaurav Tiwari, Satish Meena",1-10,1,Seed,2021-11-24,500000,USD,500000,Seed,500000,USD,500000,Seed,500000,USD,500000,500000,USD,500000,"Venture Catalysts, Sprint Vc, Titan Capital, LetsVenture, Shashvat Nakrani",2,13,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,3,,9,,,,,,,
