They receive remote updates on almost all information critical to their lives and lifestyle, and they have the ability to monitor event status and to predict and plan for change. Yet in the medical field, a physician treating a progressive disease often has no choice but to be reactive -- often with harmful results. Critical data on patient disease state is collected infrequently during sporadic office visits, yielding only a single data point to interpret past trends and assess long-term risk. Unlike their personal updates, continously available via sensors, GIS, and smart phone connectivity, there is no continuous stream of physiological measurement data from patients that can allow physicians to track and anticipate changes in disease status. The medical team cannot see how patient activity may be affecting disease indicators, and they can't see whether patients are even complying with drug therapy. The end result? More patient visits to the ER and doctor's office -- often when physiological damage has already been done. Injectsense: A New Paradigm for Therapy Management Injectsense enables tracking of progressive disease indicators and improved therapy management by providing continuous, clinically actionable information through an injectable ultra-miniature sensor coupled with a secure digital health platform. Their sensor, which can be delivered during a doctor's office visit, transforms the care model by enabling medical teams to track the disease at the pace of its evolution, whether months or years, receive early warning signs and provide preventive therapy. The configurable-on-demand sensor monitors patients 24/7, requires no patient lifestyle changes and reduces the need for medical office visits. More significantly, it allows physicians to establish an individual patient baseline for comparison, to receive data quickly at any time of day, to see histories and hourly dynamic disease state before irreversible damage is done, and to increase the effectiveness of drug therapy by tracking the effects of pharmaceuticals on key indicators over time.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Ariel Cao, Cenk Acar, Enrique Malaret",11-50,3,Early Stage Venture,2022-03-01,1700000,USD,1700000,Grant,3400000,USD,3400000,Series B,13236021,USD,13236021,14936021,USD,14936021,"Leerink Revelation Partners, National Eye Institute",2,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,6,3,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,Medical apparatus and instruments,,,

GRACE has been designed alongside some of the leading neurosurgeons in the UK, with the aim of extending patient life expectancy without impacting patient quality of life. For patients with the most common primary brain tumour, glioblastoma, there has been a severe lack of new, effective treatments for decades, with only a handful of approved options. Because of this, glioblastoma has some of the worst outcomes of any cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of <5.  Co-founder and academic neurosurgeon Dr Richard Fu recognised this and was frustrated not only by the lack of treatments available for patients but also by major design flaws in newer electric field therapy approaches. Working together with Dr Chris Bullock, a biomedical engineer who had been carrying out research at Manchester's world-class materials research centres, they formed an elegant solution designed to optimise patient life-expectancy and quality of life.  QV Bioelectronics was founded to their solution GRACE, to patients. Since then, their ground-breaking materials science research has received nearly $1M in financial awards from several UK institutions, including Innovate UK and the National Institute for Health Research in the UK, as well as over $1M in equity funding from international life science seed investors SOSV, and renowned life-science investors in Consilience & Catapult Ventures.

The shift to cloud-native applications and easily accessible cloud platforms means that developers have much more freedom to go from idea to running application. The silos across development and infrastructure have been torn down. As developers, we can now develop, build, test, deploy, and monitor our own services. Yet there are a lot of moving parts in this new cloud-native world – more discrete pieces of software like microservices and functions. There are many phases of the development and delivery flow – code review, build, unit test, containerize, integration test, binary artifacts, container cluster managers, manual and scripted release steps, health checks, and performance monitoring. We believe that developers should have tools to take care of the individual stages of that flow, and very importantly, a way to integrate, streamline, and automate the overall flow from code to ship. We started Atomist to build that platform for developers. We have deep roots in open source and serving developers at SpringSource, Pivotal/VMware, GitHub and Oracle. Our core technologies are rooted in deeply understanding the code, people, and flow. We started tackling the problem with project creation, core updates like dependencies, status notifications, and the release process because these steal big chunks of time each and every day.
