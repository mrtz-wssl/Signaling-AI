Over the last ten years, many entrepreneurs have introduced a token or coin to expand their customer network or share their stake in the company. These tokens and coins are freely tradable thanks to blockchain technology. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.",https://www.facebook.com/Cessio,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,1-10,2,Seed,2021-04-06,400000,EUR,474956,Pre-Seed,400000,EUR,474956,Pre-Seed,674956,USD,674956,674956,USD,674956,Mirrow Institute OÜ,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,48,,,15,,,,,,,

We are first and foremost a business. We aim to extract resources from asteroids to boost the Earth's economy and kick start the Space Based Economy as the vast values of some asteroids can be valued in trillions, with the largest asteroids being worth quintillions, while even small asteroids can be hugely valuable. This money will be spent in building ever growing amounts of space infrastructure so that we can eventually allow all humans who desire it to live and work in Space. Our team is currently working in partnership with the Space Robotics Lab at Tohoku University, Japan, developing SCAR-E. These low-cost, ruggedised, walking and climbing robots will be capable of undertaking asteroid, planetary and lunar exploration, alongside mining operations.   Designed to withstand exposure to radiation, high accelerations experienced during space launch, and extreme temperatures, SCAR-E will be capable of in-orbit asset maintenance such as spacewalking and extravehicular activity.

The  patent-pending technology creates a better class of beer.  For the first time ever, beer can be brewed from non-starch plant material – basically any kind of wood, shrub or grass, including plant waste (for example from a pulp mill), and including most types of food waste (for example “spent grains” left over after brewing the old way). Beers made with our technology are lower calorie, lower carb, and gluten free.  They contain beneficial compounds, including powerful prebiotics, not found in any other beverage.  Brewers can experiment with new flavours, make beers from locally sourced materials, save up to 20% on their brewing costs, and even make a second batch of beer from their spent grains – all the while, reducing their carbon emissions & waste disposal costs. Cannabis beverage companies can use the technology to make authentic non-alcoholic fermented beverages brewed directly from the industry’s primary waste stream (stalks, stems & roots) – beverages which stand out amongst competitors’ which need to be “infused” to intoxicate.  Functional beverage companies can make great tasting gluten-free fermented beverages with beneficial compounds not found elsewhere.

Hashstack scales upon the foundations of incumbent money markets (Compound, Aave, Euler Finance) by addressing the blindspots & grey areas for better-balanced risks, and value-add for the system participants, with composability at its core.  A basic summary of Hashstack's Open is as follows: Developed on the protocol of the same name, through Open, anyone anywhere worldwide can borrow up to three times their collateral, completely permission-less, without the need for trusted 3rd parties. That is, one can borrow up to US$300 with collateral of as little as US$100. This is 328% more loan against the collateral when compared to the incumbent money markets — Compound, Aave, MakerDao. The $300 loan can be spent in two ways. 1. Use the loan in its entirety as trading capital. 2. Withdraw a portion[ up to $70, i.e. up to 70% collateral equivalent] into the borrower’s personal wallet, with the balance of $230 staying within the protocol to be used as trading capital. The ownership of the balance loan remains with the Open, with the borrower having the right to spend. Open integrates dapps of critical novelty across zk L2 & L1s, where the loan can be spent. For, eg, A borrower can trade the $300 loan for equivalent BTC on DyDx on Starknet. Here, the transfer of assets happens on a protocol level between Open & DyDx, while the state change of the loan market is recorded for the borrower. If the trade returns a positive yield, the borrower makes a profit, which is for his to keep. The borrower can repay the debt and exit the transaction with positive returns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Other",,,11-50,1,Seed,2022-01-01,1000000,USD,1000000,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,Kane & Rao Group,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of Integration There is multiplicity in learning platforms & suppliers available and no one place to make holistic choices for quality skilling & workforce development products.  Lack of Gender Focus Gender focused upskilling (a big focus) remains neglected with no quality content despite budget allocation of avg USD 200k in companies over 2000 employees.  Lack of ROI focus Fragmented efforts across skilling, mentoring & coaching without business expectation mapping leads to ineffective interventions with no tangible outcomes.
