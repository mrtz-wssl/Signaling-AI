Most companies don't consider the IT asset recovery process—how they’ll retrieve the IT asset following an employee’s departure or device upgrade.

Traditional IT asset recovery using spreadsheets is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which led us to create the go-to software-driven solution for company-owned IT asset recovery.

Riven Accelerates Product Introduction with 3D Reality.  Quickly Diagnose and Fix Deviations from Design Intent.   Reach better decisions with your team and customers. New Product Introduction (NPI) is the most critical stage of manufacturing and it’s broken. An overwhelming majority of companies miss critical ship dates and suffer cost overruns due to NPI issues. Our experience designing and manufacturing thousands of physical products led us to deeply understand the costly mistakes, inefficiencies and frustration caused by sparse, error-prone analog 2D information and poor communication during NPI. These perpetual problems are only getting worse with shorter product windows, more geometrically complex products, higher quality expectations, engineering capacity constraints and fragile supply chains. Riven accelerates product introduction by vastly simplifying how teams develop, iterate and build physical products. Riven fixes broken workflows and enables everyone across the supply chain to work together – visually – on the same product by applying ‘rich as-made’ 3D part insights and digital models. By combining accurate digital 3D copies of real physical 3D parts with intelligent, collaborative software, we are creating a digital-first NPI workflow that improves customer responsiveness, time-to-market, part accuracy and production processes while minimizing development iterations and waste.

The problem is that mental health treatment providers aren't trained or equipped to help clients in financial distress, and yet financial issues must be addressed to help clients feel better. Solution - We make it easy for mental health treatment providers to ""team up"" with vetted financial counselors on our platform so that, together, they can treat individuals who are experiencing psychological distress caused by financial issues.  Benefits - With financial counseling incorporated into mental health treatment, individuals get better sooner, providers reduce churn, and payers lower their overall healthcare costs and risks. Market & MVP - At the intersection of Behavioral Health ($180B) and Financial Advice ($60B), we're starting with Problem Gambling, a rapidly growing issue as more states legalize online gambling and sports betting across the United States. GamFin is our MVP.  Traction - We have 9 state governments as customers, we've booked over $100K in revenue so far in 2023, and we've just secured our first outside investment from a startup accelerator (to be announced publicly in September). Differentiation - (i) Third-party payers pay for financial counseling services that we provide to mental health treatment providers and their clients, which eliminates their out-of-pocket costs  (ii) We use an online community-based approach to acquire, engage, and retain treatment providers, which lowers overall CAC (iii) Our HIPAA-compliant financial counseling platform is the first of its kind, bridging the gap between Behavioral Health treatment and Financial Advice.",,"Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Health Care",1,Alex De Marco,1-10,1,Seed,2023-09-11,120000,USD,120000,Pre-Seed,120000,USD,120000,Pre-Seed,120000,USD,120000,120000,USD,120000,Techstars,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,

Outfield is a precision orchard management system that provides growers with fruit counts and year round variability maps. By providing key insights on orchard performance, we help growers become more efficient, more profitable, and more environmentally friendly.  Yield estimates are crucial for all aspects of fruit growing, from maximising orchard production to agreeing sales contracts. Growers estimate yields manually based on around 0.5% of their trees. The unreliable and limited data they collect leads to 20% average errors in estimated yield per orchard. This reduces output, efficiency and profit while increasing environmental damage. Outfield growers have less than 10% error in their yield estimates. Our growers use inexpensive off-the-shelf drones, loaded with flight plans from Outfield. At the touch of a button, they make a 30-minute automated drone flight covering thousands of trees. The images are sent to Outfield’s cloud based platform and processed using bespoke image recognition algorithms. Maps and insights are returned to growers within 24hrs. This strategy allows Outfield to deploy a scalable SAAS model. Our fruit-level data platform has been developed and trialled with apple and pear growers on 3 continents, and our MVP is being used right now by paying beta-test growers in the UK, New Zealand, and South Africa. Growers have praised the unparalleled flexibility, speed and ease of drone data acquisition. We are now looking for investment to drive our growth and to scale our product to meet the growing demand. Our team is ready to build and expand international presence, to broaden our service offering with new product features, and to move into new market segments in other fruit crops.  We are entering the 4th agricultural revolution and Outfield is perfectly positioned at the convergence of machine learning, cloud computing, agritech and drone technologies.
