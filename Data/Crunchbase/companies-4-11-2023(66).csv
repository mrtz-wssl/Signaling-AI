As a result, treatment compliance rates are low, ""the internet"" has become the industry authority, and vets and technicians waste valuable time. ASTUVET centralizes 600+ digital content items and resources to help veterinarians effectively explain pathologies and treatments before, during, and after consultation.  Research shows that people remember 80% of what they see and only 10% of what they hear, so our tools are images, videos, 3D models, PDFs, and short memo brochures. ASTUVET strengthens the veterinarian-client relationship while improving treatment compliance. Vets gain time by focusing on the essentials during consultation and providing clients with the necessary resources they can re-visit at their convenience. With ASTUVET, veterinary practitioners save up to 3 minutes per consultation.   Fundraising allows us to expand our support of the vet-client relationship. We are creating the first-ever vet coach app that will deliver daily advice and activities for the pet, tailored to the animal’s age, breed, and health. The app will also support a chatbot, telemedicine, health record info, and a pet journal. Everything will be directly linked to the pet’s veterinarian.  On average, pet owners visit the veterinarian two times a year. The vet coach app will connect the owner with their vet 365 days a year. It’s like a daily visit to the vet, without leaving home.

A new way to conduct data integration combines domain knowledge of process experts with process data – An approach we call Causal Process Mining. Our software solution enables companies to leverage existing data from e.g., ERP, SCM, CRM, PLM or BPMS in order to transfer Business Process Management from subjective and time-consuming to data-driven and automated. Our solution differentiates itself from other offerings because it is tailored to avoid spaghetti-like diagrams. Instead, the focus is on the causal relationships between events and actionable insights that provide opportunities for process optimization. To this end, we provide a workflow-like procedure for analysts to identify anomalies and optimization potential – without the need to understand process modeling notations or process mining specialties.

Shooper helps solve serious problems Indonesian households are facing during the Covid-19 recession- how to save money on grocery. At the same time, Shooper helps FMCGs and other corporations get big data on offline consumers to better understand buying behavior with accurate and timely data so that they can fine tune their offerings, saving valuable resources, and gain the competitive edges. A McKinsey study shows that the Covid-19 economic downturn forces households to focus on saving money. Only the top 5% of the Indonesian SEC can afford online groceries because of the extra delivery costs. This presents a huge gap where the vast majority of Indonesian consumers largely unserved by various tech offerings in terms of saving money. Shooper collect massive big data of consumer spending by gathering users' receipts. Users upload their receipts on the app, gain many incentives such as universal point rewards, and have access to their own data. Shooper extracts the detail data, curate it, then present the data back to everyone.  Users can use the data to compare prices at physical minimarkets, supermarkets nearby. Simply create a long list of your monthly shopping needs, click a button, and Shooper will tell you which stores to go to get the lowest prices. There are many other benefits: ShooperTrack- get detailed data on your own spending so that you can track and manage your households budget. ShooperPoints- a universal point reward feature where you get points from any supermarkets, minimarkets you shop. ShooperChef- learn new recipes, and let Shooper tells you where to buy all the ingredients at the lowest prices. Shooper captures detailed data on consumers' interest, intend to buy and their final buying decisions, which we can then be used to learn, influence and reward consumers' buying behavior. Users create a shopping list of their monthly grocery needs in order to find which supermarket offers the lowest prices for everything on the list. This list is the intend to buy. The data from the list can be used to offer the right alternative products and persuade the user to switch. When the user upload the receipt, the data show the final decision. Both intend to buy and final buying data are critical for companies to reward the right behavior and offer incentive to strengthen their brands.

Also, mental health professionals have limited capacity in treating patients, and, in developing countries, mental healthcare services are practically nonexistent.

Tess automatically checks in with the patient and learns their emotional signals during conversations, also communicating this to the therapist who is then able to intervene or escalate treatment based on certain triggers. With therapist oversight, Tess delivers therapy education, health-related reminders and mental health coping mechanisms that are personalized for each patient, based on their emotional profile.

Using lab-on-a-chip technology integrated into a consumable well plate, the small nanoliter volumes used effect an almost 99% reduction in primary screening costs, while at the same time reducing filling errors and simplifying workflows by allowing single step dilution. The technology has been designed to work with most existing robotic liquid handling systems making its adoption by industry a seamless process.  The company has adapted the technology for other applications such as single-cell analysis which features a microfluidic network of trapping chambers designed to capture single cells from a larger, initial cell population which is useful in cancer, immunologic, and genetic research. Another version of the technology uses microscopic volumes for tissue organ modeling to test drug toxicity.  Neofluidics is headquartered in Carlsbad, California. Started in 2014, it holds two proprietary patents for lab-on-a-chip technology and has five product lines, including applications in the petroleum and military market segments.

SYKE Tribe is a versatile and scalable coaching platform for organizations, experts and coaches who want to make a real impact. EVOLVING BY DOING Self-development & investing in mental and physical well-being are already of high interest and becoming even more so. People are also increasingly looking for specific targets for self-development - “niche” stuff. Likewise, the digital customer experience is commonplace. Digital solutions are even sought before more traditional alternatives (such as live guidance). Well-being as well as self-development have become megatrends that have come to stay. While achieving change is a self-feeding process, more is needed; interesting content, ready-made programs, simple instructions, new goals and variation broken down into suitably sized pieces. In addition to these, people need enthusiasm, joy and motivation. Coaches, personal trainers and teachers know this well, but only now is it possible to bring that know-how and competence to everyone. That is the job of SYKE Tribe. DESIRED PARTNER & ENABLER SYKE Tribe lets coaches, experts and content producers conduct their business in a new way. We are changing the self-development industry with models of micro-learning and professional coaching. We make producing, offering and purchasing content as easy as possible for all parties.

The app is the meeting point between the coach and the trainee so that instructions, exercises, motivation and answers are always close at hand. SYKE does not focus on health technology, nor on teaching, but on teaching new skills and achieving various goals. At the center is big data: how to change people and how to change with people.
