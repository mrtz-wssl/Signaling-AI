Snooplay,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snooplay,2019-01-01,year,"E-Commerce, Information Services, Marketplace, Toys","New Delhi, Delhi, India","An online marketplace that leverages AI, striving to change the way people shop for toys & games.","69,056",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://snooplay.in,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/snooplay,"Snooplay is an online marketplace for toys & games for people of all age groups - kids and grown-ups, as well as people with special needs. At its core, Snooplay is a discovery platform that aims to help people find the right toy or game, based on their personalities, interests, skills and developmental goals.  In an age where there is an online platform for everything, the toys and games industry’s digital presence remains a nascent ecosystem. And that’s where Snooplay comes in. The brainchild of two millennials who wanted to usher the world of toys and games in India into the digital era, Snooplay is a discovery platform that uses AI to help you find the right toy or game for your child, and you! For years, we’ve been observing a rudimentary approach to purchasing toys and games in India, where offline purchases are largely influenced by the limited knowledge and expansive sales skill of the shopkeeper. And online purchases are influenced by customer bias and limited information. And this is what led to the creation of a tech-driven platform that disrupts the current buying behaviors - to ease the decision making & buying process to truly benefit the customers. At Snooplay, we understand that the problem is not searching for the right product, but actually knowing what the right product is. That’s where our AI-powered recommendation tool and informative videos come into place. Using historical data and the future developmental needs of children, Snooplay allows you to go beyond just searching for the right toys and games - it allows you to actually discover them! We have adopted a three-tier approach when offering a wide range of international and domestic brands, making it extremely easy to find the right toys and games. One, discovering toys and games across different categories, based on a child's skill developmental goals, personality and interests. Two, at Snooplay, toys and games aren’t just for kids. We cater to customers of all age groups - children or adults. And three, from destigmatizing gender-biased buying to including products for children with special needs, we are a truly inclusive platform. The goal: you find authentic toys and games you actually need (but may have not known of before) and we cater to an enriching customer shopping experience. In the very recent past on 30th August 2020, The Hon'ble Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat address, highlighted the great potential of Indian Toys. PM Narendra Modi encouraged Indians, especially start-ups to be ""vocal for local toys"", citing the nation's rich heritage and traditions that could drive innovations in the global toy industry and multiple initiatives have been set in motion. Soon, owing to the new revolution of ‘Vocal for Local’, India is anticipated to become the global hub by 2025-2030. A report by the IMARC, a market research company, stated that the Indian toy sector will cross the US$ 3.3-billion mark by 2024 at a CAGR of 13.3% between 2019 and 2024. Keeping in line with the Govt’s focus in uplifting the toys & games industry along with the population size of India, many new upcoming Indian toy manufacturers, and the increased knowledge around various types of toys and games available in the market, we believe the Indian toys and games industry can easily become one of the biggest globally and therefore there is a need to have a dedicated platform such as snooplay that brings together all stakeholders in the toys & games industry. “Toys & Games in India is currently at a nascent stage. In the age of ecommerce, more than 80% of the transactions are happening offline. As a customer, our purchasing is largely dependent on the neighborhood stores that have limitations w.r.t the collection and generic marketplaces that are search-based platforms that make it difficult to identify the right toy or a game. Snooplay aims to ease the process of finding the right toy and game for your needs, by offering a wide variety of toys and games under one roof. Given the population size of India and many new upcoming Indian toy manufacturers, along with the increased knowledge around various types of toys and games available in the market, the Indian toys and games industry can easily become one of the biggest globally.” Said the co-founders at Snooplay. After its initial launch in 2019, Snooplay has grown at an average of 300% YoY with 150 brands listed on platform, and with fresh capital infusion in the seed round, snooplay aims to scale supply by adding 500-600 sellers in the next 3 months and exponentially increase the product range for its customers and thereby become a one stop shop for all toys & games needs for customers in India and abroad. In the next 2 years Snooplay aims to have majority of the existing and upcoming local Indian manufactures and sellers of toys & games using snooplay’s platform. Currently across existing generic online marketplaces, the visibility for the local manufacturers is very limited and hence through snooplay they will be able to exclusively promote their product collection to the customers across the country and globally.",https://www.facebook.com/snooplay.in,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Information Technology",,,11-50,1,Seed,2022-07-05,535000,USD,535000,Seed,535000,USD,535000,Seed,535000,USD,535000,535000,USD,535000,Amogh Kumar Gupta,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6.99%,3,,,,,,,,,,

It operates across 10 countries with more than 200 customers, including leading hospitality, car rental, and travel brands, who enjoy Manet' solutions as tools capable of generating additional revenue, simplifying daily operations, and increasing the satisfaction and engagement of their customers. The company was founded in 2015 as the brainchild of five young entrepreneurs: Antonio Calia, Marco Barbato, Luca Liparulo, Marco Maisto and Andrea Proietti. The startup was able to raise private capital also thanks to the LVenture Group investment fund (a holding company listed on the MTA of the Italian stock exchange), to its business accelerator LUISS EnLabs (originated from a joint venture with the LUISS University) and to the related network of business angels, leading the startup to attract more than €2 million in investment over time for product and business development. Manet's initial concept relied on a fully customized smartphone designed for hotel, b&b and vacation rental guests, offering free international calls and unlimited Internet connectivity, along with the ability to book all accommodation services directly from the Manet smartphone and take advantage of a whole range of tourist content and services tailored on the destination, such as a travel guide, food and wine suggestions, utility tools (translator, currency exchange, etc.), and the ability to purchase tickets for events, museums and attractions. Starting in 2018, the Manet smartphone evolves into a digital travel assistant also aimed at the car rental industry, to equip car renters with an innovative tool to replace more traditional GPS navigators and Wi-Fi portable routers. Then, in 2020, Manet services are also being made available through the Manet App - directly installable in the travelers' smartphones - in order to offer a fully customized staying experience for hotel guests. The technological advancements in the telecommunications industry leads the company to rethink the original concept in order to develop an even more revolutionary and innovative product. In 2022, the company started rolling out Manet Travel, a connectivity solution based on eSIM (virtual SIM) technology that can bring via an app all the content and services offered on board Manet smartphones directly to the traveler's personal device. Jointly with tour operators, travel agencies, and other travel and tourism players, Manet Mobile Solutions enables travelers from around the world to enjoy a data connectivity package on their personal smartphones thanks to eSIM technology, enabling them to surf the Internet and access the universe of services and content offered by Manet and to enhance their overall abroad travel experience.",https://www.facebook.com/ManetMobileSolutions,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism",6,"Alessandro Rossi, Andrea Proietti, Antonio Calia, Luca Liparulo, Marco Barbato, Marco Maisto",11-50,3,,2018-03-30,1000000,EUR,1232954,Venture - Series Unknown,1000000,EUR,1232954,Venture - Series Unknown,1759000,EUR,2067513,1759000,EUR,2067513,"LVenture Group, Italian Angels for Growth",2,2,2,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,-35.69%,41,1,,30,0,2,,Scientific and technological services,,,

We have developed a microneedle patch using bioabsorbable metals. Our microneedle patch uses thin, soft needles that penetrate directly into the skin layer containing gout cells, thus minimizing pain. It also increases transmission efficiency by using metals such as magnesium, zinc, and calcium, which are highly absorbable by the body. We have four products: 1. Flexible bioabsorbable metal Our flexible bioabsorbable metal technology secures biocompatibility according to ISO 10993. 19 kinds of materials were developed to provide mechanical properties. Decomposition characteristics can be controlled. Our wire rods are of similar technology to that produced by industry leader Fort Wayne Metals in the United States, and we are the only company producing this kind of metal plate worldwide. Innovative materials and products can be supplied to the implant and drug delivery market at an unrivaled level. 2. Bioabsorbable metal implant Micro-invasive aesthetic medical devices can lift faces, breasts, thighs, etc. within 15 minutes. We are expected to start clinical trials with this technology in 2021, with approval by 2022. After initial approval, material-related safety data can be used in the same way, thus securing a product portfolio and accelerating the approval period and commerical competitiveness over time. 3. Bioabsorbable metal microneedle We are the first in the world to commercialize microneedles with flexible bioabsorbable metal using only essential elements in the human body. In Korea, sales are expanding through our own distribution network (on/offline in Olive Young in 2020), and exports are expanding to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Russia. Our Microneedle Patch is a platform technology that enables the development of derivative products for each disease. NDAs (Confidentiality agreement) with global companies and pharmaceutical companies have been signed and discussions for cooperation are being initiated. 4. Minimal invasive medical device Minimally-invasive medical devices for treatment of spinal stenosis can remove lesions that cause spinal stenosis within 30 minutes without surgery.

Meet the Game-Changer: AlemX AlemX is a groundbreaking platform that enables users to send tokenized stocks and cryptocurrencies directly to their friends' Web3 wallets, all within their favorite social media channels.

Now, users can send a $100 worth Netflix stock or any other tokenized stock or digital asset as a gift, making social interactions more valuable and engaging. An All-In-One Platform What sets AlemX apart from other platforms is its seamless integration with social networks and the ability to cater to users with varying levels of familiarity with digital assets. Whether a seasoned investor or a newbie to the world of cryptocurrencies and tokenized stocks, AlemX offers an intuitive interface that makes it easy to send and receive gifts in just a few clicks.

Imagine your friend paying for her coffee with the tokenized stock you gifted her, or using cryptocurrencies for everyday purchases. AlemX is changing the way we interact with our digital assets, turning them into a versatile, valuable part of our daily lives. The Power of Tokenized Stocks Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional stocks that trade on a blockchain.

With AlemX, users can tap into this exciting new asset class, transforming their social media interactions into meaningful investments and financial opportunities. Conclusion AlemX is revolutionizing the way we interact on social media, turning simple ""likes"" and comments into tangible assets that can grow in value over time.

It also demands a superior level of expertise and necessitates the need for experienced and highly professional companies to expedite the development process. At the core of every electronic product is the electronics (hardware) and firmware (software) needed to run it. Mircod experience and multi-disciplines enable the company to provide turnkey development of: • Circuit Schematics: Analog & Digital, Gerber Artwork, and Layout Design. • Embedded Systems. • Firmware & Micro Controller Programming Software Design. • User-Interface Development. • Hardware Design for CE, FCE, UL, ROHS, WEEE, and FDA. The ability to provide the right, properly “up and running” comprehensive prototype for the desired idea, while selecting the precise components, defines all aspects of a product's performance, realistic proof of concept, durability, cost, and successful market penetration. MIRCOD brings together personnel with substantive expertise in all primary disciplines required to deliver the most complicated hardware and software solutions. This flexible and multi-skilled team brings an inherent understanding of the R&D in hardware and software related activities and the interfaces with other system delivery disciplines (mathematical algorithms, system engineering, sourcing, advanced materials, and manufacturing) required for success. MIRCOD also has the advantage of having worked on a diverse range of activities across a varied customer base in both production and prototyping capacities. BIOTECHNOLOGY Industry - MIRCOD actively participates in R&D projects initiated by international consortiums. Gene therapy technology developed in consideration with international top cell and gene biotech companies and universities, guarantees to transform tomorrow's medicine by treating the causes of disease rather than the manifestations.

MIRCOD white-labeled rapid IoT web-based platform for rapid design, prototyping, design, and manufacturing is a hardware and software-agnostic system with white-label mobile apps, private BA and BI, complete device management, custom-defined analytics, and advanced AI. ROBOTICS Industry - MIRCOD AI-enabled robots are designed to work with scientists on a daily basis in a high demanding space at biotech laboratories. The MIRCOD autonomous robotic arms can be left alone to perform time-consuming biotechnological tasks in R&D biotech labs like setting up comprehensive predefined experiments in POC stations. HEALTHCARE Industry - MIRCOD team believes that today's remote monitoring technology isn't sufficiently advanced to predict a potential adverse event and alert a monitoring provider before disaster strikes. Our mission is to enhance these technologies and bring to the market an “ease of use” remote monitoring technology platform that enables continuous, configurable, wireless acquiring of biometric parameters from the human body.

The company was founded based on the pioneering work of Prof. Maria Siemionow, a world-renowned scientist and surgeon who led the team that performed the first near-total face transplantation in the United States. Professor Siemionow’s research focused on the creation of chimeric cells. This led to the development of Dystrophin Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cell therapy. DECs work by combining a malfunctioning cell of the Duchenne patient with a normal, working cell from a healthy donor. This novel chimeric cell is composed of both the donor and the recipient structures and interacts with the surroundings like a normal cell. This offers a unique advantage and allows the patient's body and immune system to accept the chimeric cell without rejection. In such a way, we have created dystrophin producing cells that can engraft the patient's muscles (such as heart, diaphragm, skeletal muscles) and increase their dystrophin levels. Increased dystrophin levels have been shown to correlate with improved functional outcomes. This technology was developed at the University of Illinois in Chicago.

With few branded players in the fashion jewelry segment, Pipa.Bella aims to solve a pain point that many women face while shopping for jewelry - branded jewelry is either overpriced with high mark-ups, or unbranded jewelry is cluttered and lacks any proper curation or style guidance.  Pipa.Bella launches approximately 100 new styles every week that are all priced well between INR 500 - 3000. The demand for fashion jewellery has grown significantly in the last few years due to high prices of gold and silver and is estimated to be a $6 billion market. The brand has hit operational profitability in FY 17-18 and is aiming to be cash flow positive in the next twelve months.  Pipa.Bella targets the 22-35-year-old urban woman who is fashion-conscious, social media savvy and is quick to adapt to latest trends. Pipa.Bella derives its name from two European words that describe the company's range of products and customers.  A typical ""Pipa"" woman is bold, edgy and always ready to experiment and a typical ""Bella"" woman is a classicist, graceful, more conservative. The brand celebrates the different styles that exemplify these two aesthetics through its product range, which consist of earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings, sterling silver jewelry, charms, personalized jewelry, wedding jewelry Pipa.Bella is a recipient of the Google SMB Heroes 2017 Award, Top 25 Startups by Singapore's Javelin Startup-O Victory Fund, and Digital Women in E-Commerce 2017 Award by Shethepeople.tv.
