We lead the field of intelligence-centric platform with a distributed learning paradigm shift such as federated learning and create an intelligence-centric platform led by world-class research scientists and engineers. Today, cloud-based AI and big data systems face significant challenges but aren’t equipped to meet them head-on. Data privacy has emerged as a global concern, but AI systems utilizing big data simply can’t preserve privacy while learning. Similarly, in a world where IoT and device data outpace the speed of bandwidth growth, latency in AI data processing is causing avoidable bottlenecks.  TieSet has developed STADLE, a Scalable Traceable Adaptive Distributed Learning platform with a core feature of decentralized federated learning that preserves privacy while collecting and maximizing intelligence to be shared. Because intelligence is created and trained locally on edge devices to be gathered by STADLE, our platform generates high-quality intelligence without uploading data, enabling AI systems to operate and perform at scale while offline.

Separating token transactions and computing by connecting the public chain and the private chain; 2. More added values by allowing miners to maintain ledger and realize project computing. As ETH is a sophisticated blockchain supported by numerous miners, we choose ETH smart contract as transaction medium for AIgatha token.  It can also avoid transaction congestion due to shortage of miners at the early phase of AIgatha. Pangu - Distributed computing system In this phase, we will implement DC system on the blockchain.  Features of Pangu Architecture: 1. The cost of the computing power engaged in the jobs depends the amount of payment. Every task released in the Primordial Soup will be involved with more than two miners. 2. More than 2 miners will be assigned to one task so as to increase the return rate; their results will be verified with each other in order to ensure the accuracy of the results simply. 3. Blockchain make the status of these tasks become open and transparent. Information includes the miners responsible for computing, the computing duration and so on. By doing so, some existing problems in the DC products such as black-box operation will be addressed. 4. Task assignment mechanism is designed to make cloud computing safer by eliminating the possibility that miners cannot assemble the whole picture of one job in spite that they are computing many tasks in one job. 5. Mist computing will reduce the dependence in the cloud computing. 6. Whitelist mechanism only allows users with ID verfication to use the system so as to aviod malicious use. 7. Simple and intuitive-to-use interface and DC API allow users to quickly master the system to solve all kinds of problems. This phase is named Pangu when we will build DC system based on LUCA. IChing -  AI services platform  At this phase, we will develop different types of AI services platform based on blockchain. Features of AI Services Platform: 1. Common/Easy File Format: Users only need to save the data file as CSV. file which can be read by the AI services platform for forecasting services. 2. Intuitive-designed Graphic Operation Interface: Programming beginners can easily use AIgatha AI services platform, skipping complicated developing process and background preparation. 3. Multiple AI Agorithms: AIgatha AI servcies platfrom can operate popular AI agorithms and will conclude with the ultimate result based on the statistics of prediction results and the development of AIgatha's technologies. 4. Forecasting Models: users can download the forecasting model built by AIgatha's AI services platform in case that it can be used for the similar topic in the future. 5. Quality Data and Powerful Analysis: data mining and machine learning will help users to develop the best applications and produce the product by searching for the answers as soon as possible. 6. Privacy and Safety: Since AIgatha's AI services platform will work out the forecasting based on statistics, users are not required to provide any name or description of eigenvalues in the dataset. The Chronos Fortress provides edge cache service that means highly privacy, consistency and extenability. 7. Selection of Important Eigenvalues: AIgatha's AI services platform will select eigenvalues for users to know which eigenvalues in the dataset are the key to the prediction, making sure users get the answers together with reasons behind. 8. Detailed and Complete Forecasting Analysis Report: Users are available to purchase the whole forecasting analysis report of the datasets that includes information processed by AI technologies such as relevant background values. Xirang - Complete Blockchain System In this phase, we plan to build/implement forecasting platforms based on the existing architecture. Moreover, improved developing interface will encourage more developers to use our project developing platform. Our ultimate goal in this phase is to deploy the Chronos Fortress around the world. The ultimate goal of AIgatha is to build a complete blockchain system, specifically including: 1. All suspending problems can resort to this blockchain for solutions. 2. The feature of blockchain will help to store a large amount of data and ensure the reliability of the source. 3. Key informations will be screened out among explosive data via the platform. 4. Information will be gathered and technologies will be developed  in an accelerating speed. 5. An open platform will be built. 6. Users-friendly and graphic developing interface will be designed. 7. Developers: they will make use of the existing computing power of the blockchain and focus on developing algorithms. 8. Users: they will be able to purchase the solutions with AIgatha token. 9. Individuals, small- and medium-size labs and corporates will be relieved with our platform.

We achieve this through cross-border credit scoring, fair risk profiles, and a portable financial history that moves from country to country with you.  Historically, people have been excluded from financial services because of, let's say, poverty. While you don’t have a proper risk profile, you fall prey to payday lenders. Now you are trapped. Others have chosen to exclude themselves from traditional financial services. What that means? They make lifestyle decisions to become nomadic in the way they live, work, and earn money. The challenge that entrepreneurs and nomads have is that they can't get an affordable rental apartment, or a mobile phone, or a credit card in their new home. Why?

We provide intelligent pricing for the hospitality industry, helping hotels maximize revenue with an automatic and self-learning software that detects opportunities and takes immediate actions.  Climber taps into a hotel’s existing reservation system and puts its machine learning to work by not only considering the historical data of the hotel but also the market demand (air traffic, local events, weather forecast, online reputation). We have an exceptional team of 14 strong individuals (9 nationalities) with complimentary skills from Data Science, Engineers, Sales to Marketing.  Everyone is operating in-person from our offices in Lisbon. A complimentary mix of hustling, Revenue Management expertise and Data Science/Mathematicians. There is a growing demand for accommodation globally and that's particularly obvious in most city hotels who are often fully booked. Managing the existing inventory and maximizing the profit is a key challenge of small hotel chains today since technology has had limited impact. From the software stack perspective a hotel typically should use three types of software (PMS + Channel Manager + RMS) and we understood that for hotels that have the need to optimize their revenue it's impossible without data driven software. We understood as well that there is a big gap in the hotel space since small hotel chains don't have access to accessible Revenue Management Systems. Due to the lack of financial capacity and know-how on how to use the current complex and expensive Revenue management systems on the market, small hotel chains end up doing daily analysis on spreadsheets that are both time-consuming and information-poor resulting in making decisions that leave hotels running below their full revenue potential.  Climber tackle the needs of small hotel chains by providing an accessible solution that is easy to use, fast to integrate and automated, replacing the manual labor on daily analysis and reporting that before was costing the hotels a massive amount of time.",https://www.facebook.com/climberhotel,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software, Travel and Tourism",2,"Joao Feliciano, Mario Mouraz",11-50,5,Seed,2019-11-12,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,541928,USD,541928,541928,USD,541928,"Seedrs, TheVentureCity, Loyal VC, Innovation Nest, Olisipo Way",2,7,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.09%,46,,,13,,,,,210650,USD,210650

This will be the first product to allow mothers, pediatricians, and lactation consultants the ability to evaluate human milk for allergens in real time.

Parents can also record any symptoms which will allow correlative and comprehensive data to assist medical professionals in determining the culprit.  This data will be compiled in a summary page which can be shared with medical professionals. The number of reported food intolerance symptoms has spiked, and our understanding of early immune development is subsequently evolving.  Converse to previous recommendations to avoid early top food allergen introduction, recent studies have shown early and sustained introduction to the infant diet may influence the risk of allergic or autoimmune disease for those patients who do not already exhibit allergic symptoms before one year of age.

It’s a problem just about everyone has experienced -- the batteries that power our smartphones, tablets and wearable gadgets run out of power too quickly. While the problem is simple, the solution has thus far proven to be more complex. As a result, nearly all of our “wireless” devices are still charged by plugging a cord into a power source.  At BEZALEL we’re focused on empowering every mobile device user to ditch the power cord, both at home and on-the-go. We design and manufacture advanced wireless charging technology destined to transform how we use today’s power-hungry mobile devices.  BEZALEL isn’t just a hardware or technology company; we’re a team of problem solvers devoted to bringing omnipresent wireless charging to everyone. When a smartphone, tablet or other mobile device loses its charge, its user loses his or her ability to stay connected to the world.
