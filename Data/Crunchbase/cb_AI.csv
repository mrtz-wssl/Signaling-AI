It offers various features to overcome the common challenges faced by businesses including; disorganized work, lack of focus, miscommunication, uncertain team morale, and inadequate planning. With AI power, it plans your day for you. We believe that to achieve success as a team, it's important for each individual to effectively plan their day and adhere to the plan. During the planning stage, 3 main questions need to be answered: “what do I need to work on?”, “how long will it take?” and, “how much time do I have?”.  Planning is important, but not enough by itself for success. Individuals need to maintain their focus throughout the execution of the plan. For ultimate focus, it is essential to minimize the distractions caused by unnecessary messages, switching between unfinished tasks, and losing track of time. With BeforeSunset’s workspace, you can plan your day by reviewing yesterday’s achievements, and unfinished tasks. You can stay on schedule throughout the day by keeping track of time for each task and focusing on one task at a time.  By tracking the time spent on each task, you can ensure that work is progressing as planned and make adjustments as needed. With analytics provided by BeforeSunset close your day by reviewing and reflecting on the progress you made. This detailed daily and weekly analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and plan your future work accordingly. Since work is not all we have, it is important to include personal planning in your day to make sure your daily plan is accurate. This doesn’t mean all your teammates see your personal todos on BeforeSunset. Our tool has the capability to make todos private if the user chooses. BeforeSunset's ""Team Timeline"" feature is designed for team members to share updates with the team such as; the task they're currently working on, their availability, meeting status, daily mood, whether they're working remotely or on-site, and who is currently working or taking time off. This helps keep everyone on the same page, prevent miscommunication, and minimize the need for additional communication.

CAST AI's intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of the project, cluster, namespace, and deployment, down to individual microservices. CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster.

For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020.  PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains.  -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball.""  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value.  -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our ""credit score for transparency."" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore.  ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development.  -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.    BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system, all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh, safe products at full margin.  CUSTOMER PROFILE Transparent Path technologies support food, pharmaceuticals, blood/plasma, transplant organs, and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods.  PARTNERSHIPS Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Duke University, and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market, and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore.  ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORS Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT.  FUNDRAISING To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, three grants, and four angel investors. In April 2023, the company was awarded grants totaling $440,000 from the National Science Foundation, ReFED, and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.   FOR MORE INFORMATION Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business. His executive team includes senior leaders from Amazon, General Mills, Microsoft, Target, KraftHeinz, Xerox PARC, and the University of California at Berkeley.

Symbolic RAG is a perfect combination of LLM and symbolic knowledge bases for hallucination-free Gen AI platform for enterprise applications. As a specialized use case, Simbo is using its Gen AI platform for medical practice automation. It helps healthcare providers reduce burnout and costs, by automating mundane tasks using proprietary Lossless clinical NLU. Simbo AI is currently automating following use cases: - AI Medical Scribe as an API: Simbo sends patient conversation transcript to all well known LLMs from AWS, Azure, and open-source LLMs and uses proprietary clinical note ranking algorithm to identify the best clinical note. Our algorithm optimizes the cost as well to ensure it fits the budget. - Autonomous AI Phone triage bot: Triages the patients on inbound and outbound calls to autonomously resolve tasks. It helps reduce burden on healthcare staff and reduce cost for medical practice. Simbo has invented a groundbreaking concept known as 'Lossless NLU,' powered by our proprietary BISLU platform. Lossless NLU takes text or voice input and transforms it into a structured meaning representation called Thought Representations, without losing any part of the meaning. In contrast to prevailing NLU methods that primarily predict intent and entities, Lossless NLU retains the full context.

The first is KwikSign - a digital signature app, which doesn't sound particularly innovative but we've approached the problem from a different angle. Our vision of the future is that people won't want to just sign contracts. There are new problems to be solved. They will need to sign any asset to either prove that they own it, approve it, agree with it, or want to protect it. This could be any asset type - contracts, video, audio, designs, drawings, deeds, code and more. In an age of artificial intelligence and fake information it's more important than ever to validate the authenticity of any asset. We achieve this by enabling any file type to be checked, validated, signed and recorded on a blockchain thereby creating a tamperproof record. Everything that is created can be linked to the validated identity of the validators to prove it is true and original. What are the use cases for this? There are many - creating deeds of ownership, issuing stock or share certificates, carrying out due diligence, recording intellectual property, confirming that a video, photo or audio file is the true and original version, in fact creating a tamperproof record of any event or asset. Our second product, launching next month, takes this one step further. Once an asset is created it needs to be transferable, tradable and traceable. To solve this problem we have built a SuperNFT which is an asset linked to the validated identities of the creators or legal owners. Because the SuperNFT 'knows' who its owners are it is also a mechanism for collecting and disbursing monies to the rightful beneficiaries, and it does this Super-quickly. Our first foray is in the world of music to enable artists to create new experiences for their audiences and to enable artists to be paid more quickly and more accurately.",11-50,1.0,IPO,2021-08-02,1800000.0,Seed,1800000.0,7.0,11-50,Public,2022-03-14,,,,,0,2,2021,7653

We lead the field of intelligence-centric platform with a distributed learning paradigm shift such as federated learning and create an intelligence-centric platform led by world-class research scientists and engineers. Today, cloud-based AI and big data systems face significant challenges but aren’t equipped to meet them head-on. Data privacy has emerged as a global concern, but AI systems utilizing big data simply can’t preserve privacy while learning. Similarly, in a world where IoT and device data outpace the speed of bandwidth growth, latency in AI data processing is causing avoidable bottlenecks.  TieSet has developed STADLE, a Scalable Traceable Adaptive Distributed Learning platform with a core feature of decentralized federated learning that preserves privacy while collecting and maximizing intelligence to be shared. Because intelligence is created and trained locally on edge devices to be gathered by STADLE, our platform generates high-quality intelligence without uploading data, enabling AI systems to operate and perform at scale while offline. Our message is simple. Collect, maximize and share the intelligence around the world. That is the world TieSet envisions for the next generation of technologies, for which we call the Internet of Intelligence (IoI) where intelligence is the one that is mainly exchanged over the Internet, not just raw private data.

Does this conversation sound familiar? I have this problem at ZIP code 39531. Can you fix it, when can you fix it and how much will it cost? Our A.I replies to that request with answers to each part. Example service request: “39531 toilet won’t flush” Example A.I assistant reply: Service Name: Toilet Repair (Won't Flush, Running, Clog) Estimated Price: $85 Soonest Arrival Window: 10/18 Thur, 9:00am-10:00am Click here to order this service Or find similar services here  Hometown Workforce is like DoorDash for services with an A.I assistant that helps consumers hire service providers. These people create a series of service listings on our marketplace. Consumers then pick the service they need, choose an available start time, and deposit 1% of the estimated total down. This 1% contractually obligates the person to show up on time and complete the work for the price estimated. If they don't they risk losing access to the platform.  This order process also runs the person's entire business. It manages payments, provides jobs, and schedules those jobs. All the person has to do is show up on time and do a good job. In exchange for this commitment to being honest and reliable, our tech can turn the skills of virtually anyone regardless of race, gender, background, or circumstances into a successful business. Angie's List and all the other lead gen sites do one thing. They connect consumers with contractors. They can't schedule the job. They can't verify the quality of work and they can't verify the price is fair. Without all 4 you can't effectively help consumers complete jobs. We take care of all 4 and more! MISSION STATEMENT: Our mission is to help eliminate poverty by turning people's skills into successful businesses. This is the first true solution to poverty I'm aware of. It's also perhaps the most powerful tool ever conceived for incentivizing people to be honest and reliable.  HOW OUR TECHNOLOGY WORKS: What makes this platform truly revolutionary is the series of listings people create on our marketplace. These listings pre-price and pre-timed their individual services.  Since each service is pre-priced we can standardize prices which eliminates price gouging, it also ensures the person gets paid.  Since each service is pre-timed the consumer can look at the person's work calendar and see all the available openings with enough hours to accommodate the specific job. Then they pick one which ensures the person shows up on time. It also provides them with jobs and manages every hour of every day. It tells the person where to go, what to do, and when to be there. There are billions of ordinary people who have skills people will pay for. They just have no idea how to turn those skills into a successful business. That’s exactly what Hometown Workforce does! We also have a training division that can provide people with skills. You choose a trade, we partner you with an instructor who will create listings specific to your career path. Consumers order those services and after you learn to do the work on the job. All the listings are turned over to you and instantly you have a successful business.

Our in-house AI/ML models help us in: - Building individual learning paths. - Optimizing marketing costs. - Deep user database segmentation (psychological, behavioral, and interests based) Customer Problem The main problem we face is the language barrier between peoples. This specifically applies to EU as a multi-lingual community. From other hand the biggest challenge for learning a foreign language is time. Advanced online technologies provide many learning opportunities but all of them require 100% focus for a long period of time which many people do not have. Products & Services To solve this problem, we turned the flashcards that students often use to memorize words into audio flashcards. Over 2000 people say that Worddio is a great tool for learning new words. With Worddio you can learn new words on the move or while doing something else, without touching your phone. Through this method, the learner will also memorize the pronunciation in the correct way, spoken by a native language speaker. We safe students time! Target Market The Worddio app is designed specifically for people learning a foreign language and who don't have time to learn and memorize new words. The Global Online Language Learning Market was valued at $12.49 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $25.73 billion by 2027. With its 34 languages Worddio has potential usefulness for over 90% of the world population. Does it work? We have more than 200K installations and more than 1300 paying users. Business Model - subscriptions: 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, lifetime - up-sales of premium content - advanced flashcards by topics, Audiobooks and Podcasts. - Ads - general or targeted based on user profiles - Apply data & technology to other platforms/apps/fields . . . Developing a B2C model on a global level takes time and resources to break even, but once that happens, the return on investment is maximized at scale. Customer Segments Professionals: adults looking to improve their foreign-language skills for business or career reasons Casual learners: travelers, expats, or other persons wishing to learn a new language or enhance their current knowledge Sector-specific: Service workers, such as call-center staff or healthcare workers, who can perform better with a larger vocabulary and accurate pronunciation.

We can build bespoke learning paths, custom sales funnels, and target ads. The data gathered allow the pursue of three main objectives: optimzing marketing resources by leveraging predictive machine learning models creating individual learning paths based on users needs upsale of particular content or products Competitors The language learning apps space looks crowded but in fact there is a specific empty niche - passive learning. There are a lot of language learning apps on the market, but none of them use a passive learning method to save time for their users - Worddio is the only one that does. We are opening a new market group to support language learning. The Worddio app is a pseudo-passive learning app powered by AI which saves student time. Competitive Advantage Worddio main advantages are: - our app’s passive learning method  - huge stock of professionally recorded audio-flashcards in 34 languages. - scientific-based approach that leverages ML and AI to optimize costs and improve user experience - premium content section - AI features that will help us deliver the ultimate hands-free experience to our users.",11-50,1.0,Seed,2021-01-05,250000.0,Pre-Seed,250000.0,1.0,11-50,Private,,,,,,0,3,2021,14869

AI has the potential to give mass consumption apps a huge pick-me-up: these are the kinds of tools we are developing in our studio. We are constructing our latest project from the ground up: optimizing a consumer app by leveraging the power that lies at the intersection between AI and social behaviors. The Apply AI studio team has history in Latin America but have relocated to Silicon Valley. We have been building products for the social web since 2005, when we started Taringa.net, an intelligence collective social network. Our team has worked together for the past 10 years building what grew to become the largest social network ever created in Latin America with millions of users worldwide.  In many LATAM countries, Taringa is the second largest social network, just after Facebook and ahead of Twitter. Also, Taringa was the very first massive consumer platform to incorporate bitcoin as a way to share revenues within its community. Today, our team is taking advantage of the benefits of AI technology by building a wide array of new AI tools and applying them to new products,  such as Gif Surfer, a gif discovery platform which uses AI specifically for image recognition and AI machine learning and big data, in order to identify content and serve Gifs that we can guarantee users will love.

LensAI prioritizes first-party relationships and targets audiences based on the content they are interested in and drawn to, not personal information about users. LensAI does not depend on cookies or alternative user-level identifiers while enabling Advertisers to reach relevant audiences by tailoring ads to the context. As users have become very particular about the kind of ads they want to see, LensAI focuses on providing value with every ad. To make it more fun, LensAI's in-image and in-video ads look like shopping hints that users may have seen in video games rather than traditional ads. The analytics engine of the LensAI technology measures how every ad performs contextually and how different contexts perform against each other and in general.

Most likely your business is going to bring your products and services to your customers doorstep. However, straight away you’re faced with a complex problem… should you develop an expensive software solution or, do you use what’s on the shelf and put the extra time and resources into growing your core business idea? Unfortunately, what’s on the shelf won’t give you a competitive advantage against the larger companies that have hand built their own solution. Without a custom solution you simply won’t be efficient enough to survive in the long term. This is where fieldd comes in! Fieldd powers your mobile services that travel to your customer’s home or work, and does so in a way that gives your customers the impression that you have hand built your own custom solution. Fieldd is different to other platforms because fieldd focuses on automating and prioritizing the customer experience. From the moment your customers book your services online, they are guided through a unique customer experience to turn them into a customer for life. Other platforms simply hold your customers’ details and often are no better than an address book. This unique “loop” to keep your customers engaged isn’t possible on other platforms and companies are forced to use a range of solutions to get the job done. Why hasn’t this been done before? Put simply, building fieldd has been a hard process! After 3 years of initial R&D & 30,000+ live R&D bookings, fieldd was launched in 2019 and now is the software of choice in 15 countries across 20 different industries. 15 years ago the thought of McDonald’s delivering your food was a futuristic thought. Today with the latest technology, UberEats has made this idea an everyday solution. 15 years ago the thought of catching a taxi was also not an everyday solution due to the inconvenience of booking, tracking & paying for your taxi. Yet today, technology has pushed taxis to become an everyday solution. The demand for customer convenience has always been on the rise and with COVID, this need has been supercharged even further. 100% of the time customers will instantly book the best priced, fastest service provider to come to them. Yet 98% of businesses rely on a 15 year old quote request form with a 1-5 day reply time. Before Uber entered the taxi & food industry, these two industries represented industries that were waiting to be optimized with technology. The amount of other service industries that are currently highly inconvenient and can be optimized, is practically endless. Prior to fieldd, the automation and customization within fieldd that are included with every plan, were only possible with custom software development. Now, it’s possible with a click of a button. Every day we are unlocking hidden potential in field service businesses globally, we look forward to seeing your business do the same.",11-50,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,11-50,Private,,,,,,6,5,2019,24577

Data on blockchain though is extremely noisy, hard to read and even harder to make sense of them. Openstory was created in order to organize and democratize the access of blockchain data so users can make educated decisions, based on information and knowledge that before was only available to highly technical funds and companies. What’s happening on-chain Openstory is not a siloed API aggregator, a hand-picked catalog, or a centralized recommendation web2 service. Openstory is an indexer that focuses on scanning and unveiling on-chain truth like a story so everyone can easily make decisions based on objective information. What you see in the platform is not a recommendation from an employee or the curated information of APIs; instead, our database starts and ends with indexing the public on-chain information, offering a pure outcome of how people use and interact with web3. How challenging is this? Mapping web3 is both a data intelligence challenge and a UX challenge. How do we display the information meaningfully and drive usage beyond? How deep do we go? Your feedback is essential to its success, so we'd love you to be part of this journey early on. How to use Openstory The initial token/NFT sale can be the beginning of the experience, not the end. A creator or a brand can use Openstory to see how web3 users use/interact with their creations, spot their audience (who is buying and what’s their engagement) and reward them accordingly. A collector can use Openstory to assess if an NFT is worth buying based on usage/investors attracted, discover the up-and-coming collections, meet other collectors/soulmates, and create deeper relationships with the artists they love. A flipper can discover the most recent collections that grow exponentially. Everyone can check key market metrics, e.g., active users in the market, market growth, and marketplaces with the highest traction, so they have a better picture of the market they invest their money and time.",1-10,0.0,M&A,,0.0,,0.0,4.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,5,3,2021,27403

This creates a very low barrier to entry and eliminates awkward conversations about signing up for a new card together - plus they don't want to do that anyway. Couples set up a default split % for all of their shared expenses that they can adjust on a per transaction basis if they want.  Users swipe which expenses they want to move from their private view to the couples shared view.  Smoov keeps track of the total damage (who owes who how much) and whenever the couple is ready, they can settle up via direct ACH transfer through Smoov. Why?

Critical decisions cannot wait for manual analysis to create contextual meaning from insights, they need to be automated to deliver decision guidance and Augmented Outcomes for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. Decision Point AI™ is the company that has an Augmented Intelligence Platform that facilitates Decisive Impact for Companies, Executives and Shareholders. It utilises Decision Science instead of Data Science to focus corporate efforts on critical and Augmented Outcomes to deliver Decisive Impact to its clients. Decision Point AI™ is vertical and horizontal Market agnostic and is focused on technology and consultancy services for any industry or organisation. Our Augmented Intelligence Platform is already in use in Government decision making and Decision Point is currently engaging with a number of commercial clients on their specific business cases. Decision Science Data driven decision making augmented intelligence #dddm_ai ""Decision Point AI™ augmented intelligence supports decision making when there is a lack of data to otherwise make decisions"" While the standard pathway for Decision Science is to focus on data as a tool to make decisions and solve business problems. Decision Point has further augmented the current thinking by adding collated data through an augmented intelligence platform and applying human interpretive algorithms that enable expert context to establish both true meaning and trajectory in a real time manner. Real time DDDM through Decision Point AI™ dddm_ai establishes a clear competitive advantage in a world where enterprises are told competitive advantage no longer exists DDDM_AI is fundamentally different from the slower data science route which is involved in finding insights by analysis and modelling from data, after this data has been collected, processed and structured by data engineer. While business who are ""driven most by data-based decision making had 4% higher productivity rates and 5-6% higher profits, a study of 179 large publicly traded firms"" by Brynjolfsson, Hitt and Kim of MIT Center for Digital Business found in 2011 based on Data Science. No impact analysis currently exist for the evolutionary real time DDDM_AI that utilises augmented intelligence but by extrapolation the expectation is for higher productivity, utilisation and profits for client companies. Subjective Logic Augmented Intelligence A fundamental aspect of the human condition is that nobody can ever determine with absolute certainty whether a proposition about the world is true or false. The human capacity to create theories or hunches can have profound impact on the direction and effectiveness of organisations, enterprise and countries. Decision Point utilises an Augmented Intelligence Platform built on subjective logic to refine and explicitly emphasise the factors and certainties that underwrite decision options. Additionally the Decision Point Augmented Intelligence Platform utilises human insights as part of its data queries to augment the processing power of the AI with context and meaning of that data through human knowledge and expertise. Subjective logic is a type of probabilistic logic that combines the capacity of probability theory to handle uncertainty with the capacity of deductive logic to exploit structure of formal argument. Subjective logic explicitly takes uncertainty and source data trust into account. Subjective logic is suitable for modelling and analysing situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources. Subjective logic can be used for modelling and analysing trust networks where a measurement of the degree to which one social actor (an individual or a group) trusts another social actor and Bayesian networks that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,4,2019,41240

We use AI to enhance fitness instructors, not to replace them, because we believe it's time to put community back into community-based fitness. With 9 out of 10 Americans planning to continue to work-out from home traditional fitness is getting left behind with pen & pencil or low-tech band-aids while AI fitness is removing the human element altogether. But humans crave social connections with other humans - in fact, it's the greatest predictor of longevity. Our user interviews confirm the importance of community with 53% of people who exercise and 91% of trainers reporting that they enjoy the aspect of community and interaction with others.  Our easily accessible, mobile solution does not require any hardware and allows fitness instructors to provide real-time, motivating feedback during remote, or hybrid, interactive classes, without having to stop demonstrating proper form and technique while saving countless hours on data analysis through AI generated insights and customized, actionable wellness plans.

Almost every company is gathering a lot of data and is looking for professionals who can analyze that data in order to make predictions & generate insights. Companies like Tencent are employing several thousands of data scientists who are using data and building machine learning models in order to generate predictions & make smarter decisions. Unfortunately, the demand for data scientist exceeds the supply. According to McKinsey research, there will be a shortage of 1.25 million data scientists by 2024. Quality data scientists are hard to find and expensive to employ as a single quality data scientist costs about $117,000 per year according to Glassdoor research. The data scientist has to then spend 45% of their time on model building that we believe is a very repetitive & time consuming process. On top of that, organizations that are thinking about building an in-house solution require more than 3.5 million RMB in investment & usually more than 6 months of development.  That is why we’re building mltrons, which is predictive analytics in 5 clicks. We’re are enabling organizations to build and leverage advanced machine learning & deep learning algorithms without ever writing a single line of code or worrying about investing in infrastructure. The users just need to prepare the data and upload it into the application after which they need to tell the system what they want to predict. Then automatically, our AI engine builds the best fit model for their problems and provides them with real-time predictions and insights.  Our AI engine is built on a robust architecture with state of the art algorithms. Our goal is to get companies from raw data to actionable predictions in the fastest way possible. Mltrons Ai engine can be connected to various data sources after which it loads the data, prepares and cleans the data, build hundreds of thousands of combinations of algorithms and then selects the best model for the problem that can be easily deployed in one click, either by using REST API, uploading new data or using our visual prediction. In essence, mltrons is simple yet scalable. But most importantly, mltrons is accurate & intelligent because as more data is fed it, it gets smarter.",1-10,1.0,Seed,2019-05-01,0.0,Pre-Seed,0.0,2.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,2,5,2019,47942

With our unique approach of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks, KAPUA's customers enjoy MAPEs (mean absolute percentage error) and WMAPEs (weighted mean absolute percentage error) in the lower single digits. This increased accuracy allows organizations to lower working capital while improving fulfillment levels.   Related research in this field suggests a 3M profit increase on a 100M business driven by a 10-20% improvement of forecasting accuracy, and KAPUA set out to take this even further. In multiple cases, we're able to reduce a company's forecasting error to a 10th of what it was before. As AI is taking over a lot of the manual work, planners can now focus on developing new strategies to maximize revenue and minimize working capital.   Because AI is able to detect patterns in your internal and external data sets, our implementation approach becomes really low-touch and therefore extremely accelerated: we can set up a tenant in our public or private SaaS environment within a few weeks from start to finish.

Its core is based in linguistics, enabling it to go where AI cannot readily go and do what AI cannot possibly do.  It skirts the current industry paradigm of creating software-based products whose logic is based on a human programmer's knowledge and ability.  We have dubbed this new realm 'Human-Like Intelligence' (HLI).  The HLI 'agent' is trained in English rather than with numbers and data.  For analysis and problem solving, it does not use scripted or programmed methods. For its enabling technology, Itoric has one patent issued, one pending and another in process . HLI contrasts with AI-based intelligent systems is that it quite accurately mimics human thinking.  Traditional situationally-dependent programming or scripting is not used, neither by Itoric nor the end customer.  HLI instead depends upon English-language teaching, back-stories, observations and situational briefings.  Itoric's HLI is Subject-Matter Expert (SME) trained, something for which no equivalent exits under the AI paradigms of the past 70 years.  For autonomous systems, the accuracy and completeness of an HLI's assessments and decisions are driven by the completeness of its text-based training.  Unlike programmed autonomous systems, performance does not depend on how accurately software requirements were defined or how insightful its programmers were. Beginning in 2013, the founder created new IP for a method of storing concepts and knowledge in a now-patented specific form of data graph.  Access to the HLI's gained knowledge is linguistics-based, and every neuron in it is self-describing, in English.  Its internal data graph design allows for rapid multi-dimensional accesses of concepts and knowledge.  With superior linguistic approaches, it understands every-day nuanced meanings and purpose for every word in a sentence or fragment of speech.  Concepts in its graph-like memory are learned, managed and updated primarily in ordinary English.  Training is text-based, created by subject-matter experts, whether dealing with how to walk or the implications of human action.  The enabling technology was its patented neuron structure that each represents a single concept.  With this, the creation of a robust English parser and related semantic analyzer were possible. The analysis of external text's emotional content is a natural byproduct of the HLI's semantic analyzer, as it the very concept of topic.  Both of these are difficult for conventional systems, as is the correct interpretation of colloquial idioms in context.  Here, they are natural outcomes flowing from the semantic analyzer. Many fundamental paradigms, tenants and methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are demonstrated to be self-limiting and self-perpetuating.  They have confined Artificial Intelligence to niches far removed from the original lofty dreams of a ""general intelligence"".  That is, AI cannot be applied almost anywhere human-like intelligence is needed, whereas Itoric's HLI system can be.  The timeframe for AI arriving at such an inflection of general intelligence remains 20 years distant, a prognostic delayed year over year. In its persistence, Itoric has overcome high barriers to entry for general intelligence, having solved intractable unbounded problems.  The HLI is *not* bio-mimetic.  Rather, the psycho-mimetic nature of the Visel Mind Model readily handles cultural idioms, regional culture, human values, political issues, and even the broken English that makes up today's (English) communication.  The initial target market for Itoric's HLI are the autonomous analysis of intelligence, finding its implications, and the control of systems where a human in the loop is not practical.  A general manager from one of the three-letter agencies disagreed with the founders assessment as to the HLI's market estimate of $200B.  He insisted that the more realistic estimate is $3T.  The founder has since come to ready agreement with that assessment. The development status of the HLI is currently Technology Readiness Level 5 or 6 (TRL 5 or TRL6) for the framework, parser and semantic analyzer.  The HLI's mind model  operates on low power and modest memory resources, not the estimated tera-flops needed for AI. Itoric will be seeking about $10M and about 18 months to deliver a first-generation product to the initial Intelligence or aerospace industries.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,5,2019,65256

The company was founded in 2018 by a team of analysts and investment professionals who had formerly worked as part of a development group in a San Francisco angel capital office.  Previously, the team had been tasked with building various in-house data solutions, including one to supply structured XBRL financials to subsidiary Revere Data (later acquired by FACTSET).  It was through this experience that the basis of SDS as a standalone provider was born.   The lightbulb moment for the team came when it moved beyond standard financials (Income Statement/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) and began mining esoteric tables buried in 10K/Qs, such as REIT FFO (Funds From Operations) for a hedge fund manager client.  Although outside of the ordinary workflow, SDS tools easily accomplished the task with a skeleton crew of staff and a microscopic budget (compared to incumbent data purveyors).  At that point, the decision was made to commercialize. Since 2018, SDS has been in stealth mode, quietly improving its semantic parsing engine and its user interface, while preparing for a public launch.  We intend to disrupt a well established and very static industry which currently relies mostly on manual processes to populate databases.  Through automation, our platform improves the efficiency of collecting, maintaining, and updating financial information by an order of magnitude.

As practicing physicians, each day we see the limits and failings of existing EMR systems. Those systems have demonstrated that they are incapable of scale. They impose artificial patient capacity limits on physicians and represent a contributing source of physician burnout. As a result, healthcare has outgrown its current technology and patient care suffers.  Our mission is to change this with Artificial Intelligence. And with that, to create a paradigm shift in patient care, allowing physicians and healers to contribute knowledge and leverage the latest innovations in AI technology to develop an intelligent patient outcome feedback loop.  Our AI model has been specifically designed to accelerate the advancement of clinical therapies and expand the reach and impact of these advancements. This will permit medicine to bring to reality the dream of equity inpatient care by accruing and sharing physicians’ cumulative discoveries, knowledge, and experiences with every single patient encounter. To accomplish this, we have built the foundation of our company on passion, care, and most importantly, re-imaging what is possible through creative Artificial Intelligence innovations applied to medical care.",1-10,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,3.0,1-10,Private,,,,,,6,5,2019,80378
