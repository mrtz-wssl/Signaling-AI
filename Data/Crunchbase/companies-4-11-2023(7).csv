There is no cure for DMD and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Our lead product candidate, SGT-001, is a gene transfer under development to restore functional dystrophin protein expression in patients' muscles. Based on our preclinical program, we believe the mechanism of action of SGT-001 has the potential to slow or even halt the progression of DMD. In 2015, we began exclusively licensing the elements of the construct for SGT-001 and other elements of our gene transfer program from the University of Michigan, the University of Missouri and the University of Washington.

Consisting of a group of AI experts in computer vision, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, Medipixel conducts research and product development for lung cancer diagnosis and coronary intervention robots together with the best healthcare professionals in Korea such as Seoul Asan Medical Center. In November 2018, MediPixel won the championship in the QuickFire Challenge hosted by Johnson & Johnson.  MediPixel currently offers three solutions for intervention surgeons: 1. An AI Based Diagnosis Solution makes it possible for doctors to spot lesions while performing a coronary angiography, perform segmentation of the vessel in question within just one second and analyze the lesion’s status. 2. A Guide & Planning Solution clearly visualizes the hidden part of the coronary artery to make doctors perform guidewire manipulation with more ease and confidence, which is quite useful especially in case of CTO. Furthermore, the solution frees doctors from the need to use contrast -- this is important because contrast can cause potentially fatal reactions in 5 to 10% of patients. 3. An Automated Navigation Engine automates navigation through coronary arteries. Once the destination is reached, it controls a robotic unit by giving the most appropriate real-time commands in its existing situation, thus delivering devices such as guidewire to the destination in the most efficient way. We're open to any candidates who are excited to apply their knowledge and skill in deep learning to real-world medical data and surgery robots. Do you have any questions?

Fusion’s ability to link the most effective isotopes to the targeting antibody allows for the creation of optimized agents for both diagnostic imaging and radioimmunotherapy (Precision Medicine). Following positive tumor identification with the imaging agent, treatment with the antibody linked to a therapeutic isotope delivers a cytotoxic payload into the cancer cell. Fusion’s lead product candidate, FPX-01, is a precision RIT that is a product of this innovative approach.
