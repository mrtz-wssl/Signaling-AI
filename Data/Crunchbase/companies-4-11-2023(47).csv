The company offers software as a service platform that enables the business to business marketers to develop data-driven content marketing strategies. The B2B buying journey is more complex and multifaceted than it’s ever been. Sales cycles are longer and more individuals are involved in buying decisions, each with their own roles and priorities. They’ve also entered a new era where buyers are discovering and learning about companies through multiple online touchpoints, making content the centerpiece of their buying journey. These changes require that successful B2B marketers be buyer-centric. To rise above the noise and drive engagement and consensus among the multiple people (personas) in an account, marketers must provide high-quality content, messaging, and interactions that support buyers’ needs and processes in the manner they desire. Achieving this, however, is dependent on having a truly deep understanding of your buyers. The challenge marketers face is that existing technologies do not fully support this shift from being vendor-centric to buyer-centric because they’re solely focused on execution. While content production, account-based marketing, and personalization solutions exist, none of them can be used to their potential without first having Marketing-Sales alignment on the audience, how they buy, and how to effectively sell to them.

We call it ""the event-based security model"". Most of the video surveillance software products currently available on the market operate in two categories: time of recording and source. This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras. Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave. In the next two years we will make Faceter support protocols for several leading smart house platforms and standard callback APIs. When integrated with urban services, Faceter can be configured to perform specific actions, such as sending alerts to 911 if there are signs of violence or incipient crime.",https://www.facebook.com/FaceterOfficial/,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Privacy and Security, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Robert Pothier, Vladimir Tchernitski",11-50,1,,2018-02-07,28610352,USD,28610352,Initial Coin Offering,28610352,USD,28610352,Initial Coin Offering,28610352,USD,28610352,28610352,USD,28610352,JaMes Sowers,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,1,"43,632",,,,,,,,

To solve this problem, STAR'S TECH developed and commercialized the world's first eco-friendly de-icing agent using starfish extract. This unique solution provides superior results when compared with other traditional de-icing methods. ECO-ST1 is an eco-friendly de-icing agent made from sea waste starfish. It is developed by researchers at Seoul National University and helps reduce the overhead costs of deicing by up to 90%. 80% of the cost of de-icing is overhead. ECO-ST1 prevents traffic accidents through rapid and continuous melting and minimizes iron corrosion and concrete damage to minimize the cost of repairing roads, bridges, vehicles, and guard rails. It also solves road damage by minimizing plant sulfurization. STAR'S TECH has developed an innovative technology to extract the porous structures from starfish. Unstable chloride ions resulting from deicing are absorbed by these porous structures through electrostatic force. Starfish extract helps control chloride ion concentration, which can otherwise be detrimental to the environment. This technology also enables corrosion inhibitor reaction by using very few anti-corrosion agents. ECO-ST1 is manufactured in a bead form rather than the commonly used flake form. This bead is coated with starfish extract and a diffuser for de-icing. Beads are advantageous because they have greater penetration and de-icing performance. Also, as this starfish-coated bead does not create dust, it does not cause respiratory problems.",,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Science and Engineering, Sustainability",1,SeungChan Yang,11-50,5,,2021-06-01,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,2150000000,KRW,1922185,2150000000,KRW,1922185,"Bluepoint Partners, TIPS Program, NH Investment & Securities, Premier Partners, Hanwha Investment & Securities",5,6,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,5,2,Dyes; Paints; Polishes; Natural Resins; Adhesives; Miscellaneous Compositions; Miscellaneous Applications Of Materials,Chemical substances,,,

SoHHytec alleviates the current dependency on fossil fuels by bringing a cleaner, greener, sustainable, and cost-effective system for fuel and power production. Hydrogen is deemed to be the fuel of the future, though today 96% of world hydrogen production comes from offsite steam reforming of conventional fossil fuels and is then transported to its final places of utilization. This is neither clean nor renewable and is costly, polluting, and time-taking. SoHHytec provides a fully clean and green system for hydrogen production additionally co-generating electricity and heat. We alleviate and eliminate the grid instability problems which occur with intermittent renewable energy sources like solar energy as this source's energy is stored in an energy-dense fuel via our product. SoHHytec's vision is to be the game-changer for realizing a sustainable hydrogen economy. Our aim is to make the fuel of the future i.e. hydrogen, a reality of today.",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Saurabh Tembhurne,1-10,4,Seed,2022-01-20,2000000,USD,2000000,Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,2283288,USD,2283288,"Venture Kick, Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT), FUND FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND ENERGY (F4SE)",3,3,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,350185,USD,350185

Development efforts are currently underway with the time to first release estimated to be 18 to 24 months. TempoQuest’s suite of software solutions are being designed to run on graphic processor unit accelerators (GPUs) instead of CPUs, dramatically increasing the speed and accuracy of analysis.  Though GPU accelerators are currently in use for other ‘big data’ applications, the technology has not yet been applied to comprehensive weather data analysis. As currently practiced, satellite sensors, drones, radar, etc., will continue to collect global weather data. TempoQuest will then process this data and provide it to today’s major specialist weather companies, such as The Weather Company, AccuWeather, and others. For several of their high-value end users, like commodity traders, insurance firms, power utilities, major agricultural companies, etc., speed and accuracy are critical to the success of their businesses and an extremely valuable asset.

We digitise trade documents using leading-edge OCR and ML systems. Along with other data that we collect, we generate real-time ESG scores on factories and deliver efficient trade finance and supply chain finance into the international supply chain at shipment. Our revolutionary worker app collects data continuously directly from workers in factories on pay, conditions, safety and governance. Worker data is used to create a factory social score, and to monitor for issues (forced labour, bad conditions, unsafe practices).; the social score is also used to drive the cost of trade finance into the supply chain so that continuous improvement can be delivered via supplier economics.  Companies are ready to spend significant sums right now to evaluate, monitor and manage ESG issues in their supply chains. This is a big and global market, poorly served, very motivated for innovation. There is a massive data gap in the market, as ESG information is typically based on annual surveys and self-certified reports. What is needed is “real-time ESG” data, delivering trusted data that is updated continually worker, factory, product and shipment level. Technology can be used to solve this problem. Barriers to entry are high. Designing and building real-time ESG data collection systems requires significant infrastructure and a lot of know-how. The problem is difficult to solve and no one else seems to be attacking it right now. Significant additional value is created if real-time ESG data can then linked to trade finance; this provides the tools for larger corporates to drive continuous improvement in their ESG performance whilst also allowing large corporate importers to save money immediately. The problem is worth solving and the solution has a number of interesting dimensions. We are experiencing high demand for our services, and we are live with major retailers and brands supporting their international supply chains, getting their suppliers paid at shipment (trade finance) and collecting the real-time ESG data on worker conditions that enables them to drive improvements in social and governance issues deep into their supply chains. We pivoted out of an export trade finance business (a credit and balance sheet business) to a pure SaaS fintech early in 2021 for strategic reasons.

For Music and Creative Executives: MyPart’s award-winning technology uses reference songs- rather than conventional “tagging” techniques- to help A&Rs, Sync, and Music Supervisors “dig” through and prioritize their musical catalogs and/or discover new talent. This helps these industry decision-makers find songs that share common harmonic, melodic, lyrical, sonic and structural features with their predefined benchmarks, and ensures they only listen to the “right” songs that actually match their needs.   For Songwriters: MyPart’s AI analyzes songs submitted by emerging songwriters from all over the world, in order to place them with opportunities in the Music, TV/Film and Advertising Industries. We believe your songs deserve a shot, and create matches purely based on song relevance, rather than personal connections or industry access. MyPart graduated from Universal Music's exclusive Abbey Road RED program in London and Capitol Records' gBeta program in LA, as well as Deloitte's LaunchPad Growth program, and won the MassChallenge 2018 gold award and Music Week 2021 Tech Summit. Its proprietary 'Song Mining' engine conducts comprehensive and granular analysis of lyrical, musical and sonic relevance based on a wide technology stack that combines machine learning, computational linguistics, and digital signal processing to determine the likely relevance of any song to any set of reference songs.  Our unique approach combines two key qualities: The ability to search for songs with a set of reference songs We created a song fingerprinting technique that abstracts song DNA to enable searching for songs with reference songs, based on common harmonic, melodic, lyrical, sonic and structural features A distinct focus on the semantics and aesthetics of song lyrics.
