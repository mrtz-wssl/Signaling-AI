Nearly all solid cancers grow faster than their blood supply, leading to regions of low oxygen in the tumors and HIF activation. The HIFs in turn induce the expression of over 100 genes that help tumor cells survive and spread. OncoSpherix has several classes of small molecules that block activation of HIF-1 through novel mechanisms. OncoSpherix’s lead clinical candiate has been shown in mouse models to reduce primary tumor growth, inhibit metastases, and prolong survival in many types of cancer (glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, uveal melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer).

Currently, cancer incidence in the world exceeds 14 million cases per year and results in 8 million deaths annually. Moreover, such numbers are forecast to rise by 75% over the next 20 years (World Cancer Report. International Agency for Research on Cancer 2014). At the moment, standard therapies include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, in a restricted subset of cancers, precision medicine. Unfortunately, very often these therapies fail, due to the development of resistance. Peptomyc has adopted a different strategy based on the inhibition of the oncoprotein Myc, which is found deregulated in the majority of human cancers.

The emissions created by Europeans cheese consumption alone is the equivalent to Belgium’s total emissions.  Our new bean-based range produces up to 6 times less CO2 than the dairy alternatives it’s replacing. We believe that holistic solutions are needed to create major changes in our food system – having recently secured B Corp status and begun growing beans in the Netherlands in 2022, we’re on track to address many of the problems at their root cause. In May 2022 we completed a 2m EUR pre-Series A. The raise will enable us to bring our delicious, beautifully branded range of PBC’s to 3 new markets: the UK, Germany and the Nordics, bringing in senior hires and continuing on our quest to become the world’s first net-positive plant-based cheese company. The investment was led by early-stage investor Rockstart and PINC, Paulig’s venture arm. Döhler and Feast Ventures also participated as co-investors alongside a number of angels. ---- Don’t take our word for it…  Marika King, Head of PINC, says, “Willicroft is by far the tastiest plant-based cheese range we have come across. It has a more nutritious and sustainable ingredient list than most alternatives available today and a high-powered team with traction in Europe, so we could not be more excited to support this venture.” Mark Durno, Managing Partner AgriFood, Rockstart, says, “Willicroft is taking plant-based dairy alternatives to the next level. Alongside making delicious products, they are helping farmers to transition to sustainable production by enabling a local supply chain without the need for monocropping or highly processed ingredients.

As the CEO of Shipshape Urban Farms, I am committed to leading our company on a path of innovation and growth that reshapes the sustainable farming landscape. In 2023, we are driven by our focus on container gardens, fostering sales and introducing our concept to individuals, families, and businesses alike. The construction of three modular container gardens serves as our hallmark in Birmingham, Alabama, where innovation meets reality, generating a substantial $45K per month in revenue. This landmark achievement is only the beginning. We are excited to pilot partnerships with esteemed grocery store chains, nearby restaurants, and bustling farmers markets, cementing our place as pioneers in sustainable agriculture. Looking ahead to 2024, we will embark on a journey of growth and investment. Our aim is to raise $10 million, propelling us toward the creation of our first HAB in Huntsville, Alabama, a 3D-printed marvel. Simultaneously, we will expand our contracts with grocery stores, working tirelessly to secure our position as a leading supplier of fresh, locally grown produce. The path to our goal is paved with essential milestones: completing carbon capture testing with the National Carbon Center, forging impactful collaborations with NASA, signing contracts for five new Container Gardens, and realizing the completion of our Birmingham Farm. Partnerships for the construction of our HABs are instrumental in our progress, amplifying our vision and reach. With our sights set on 2025, we plan to raise a combination of VC and/or bank loans $200 million to construct 20 new HABs across the United States and strategic locations worldwide. Our partnerships with grocery stores flourish, and we will expand our impact and influence on the food industry. We anticipate the launch of our inaugural project with NASA and Above Space, a testament to our prowess in innovation and cutting-edge technology. By signing contracts for 45 new Container Gardens, we will make a resounding statement about the future of sustainable agriculture. After celebrating a full year of operation for our Huntsville HAB, our vision will extend to new revenue streams, including the sale of HABs to third parties, carbon capture endeavors, and a promising collaboration with NASA in the realm of space. By 2026, our focus shifts toward operating with precision and excellence, optimizing every facet of our endeavors. This sets the stage for 2027, when we embark on the next phase of our journey: the pursuit of an exit strategy that honors our mission, our investors, and our relentless pursuit of redefining urban farming. Together, with a dedicated team and steadfast commitment to sustainability and innovation, we at Shipshape Urban Farms are on a mission to cultivate a greener, more nourished future for all. Our container gardens, HABs, and pioneering partnerships are but the beginning of a groundbreaking era in sustainable agriculture.

The intricacies of growing a brand are complex but the underlying mechanism is simple: keep current consumers happy while consistently obtaining new consumers. The key for a successful brand to make consumers happy is to know when they become unhappy. Consumer feedback is gold. When consumers share their story, they’re not just sharing pain points. They’re actually providing personal insight on how to make your product, service, and brand better. Wyzerr makes it easier for  brands to obtain consumer feedback in real time by integrating customer feedback into daily operations. This allows brands to track productivity and efficiency in real-time. With Wyzerr, brands can immediately correct any customer issues, address potential “fires” before they spread, and validate changes in products & services.
