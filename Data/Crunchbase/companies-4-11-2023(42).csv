Nearly all solid cancers grow faster than their blood supply, leading to regions of low oxygen in the tumors and HIF activation.

As the CEO of Shipshape Urban Farms, I am committed to leading our company on a path of innovation and growth that reshapes the sustainable farming landscape. In 2023, we are driven by our focus on container gardens, fostering sales and introducing our concept to individuals, families, and businesses alike. The construction of three modular container gardens serves as our hallmark in Birmingham, Alabama, where innovation meets reality, generating a substantial $45K per month in revenue. This landmark achievement is only the beginning. We are excited to pilot partnerships with esteemed grocery store chains, nearby restaurants, and bustling farmers markets, cementing our place as pioneers in sustainable agriculture. Looking ahead to 2024, we will embark on a journey of growth and investment. Our aim is to raise $10 million, propelling us toward the creation of our first HAB in Huntsville, Alabama, a 3D-printed marvel. Simultaneously, we will expand our contracts with grocery stores, working tirelessly to secure our position as a leading supplier of fresh, locally grown produce. The path to our goal is paved with essential milestones: completing carbon capture testing with the National Carbon Center, forging impactful collaborations with NASA, signing contracts for five new Container Gardens, and realizing the completion of our Birmingham Farm. Partnerships for the construction of our HABs are instrumental in our progress, amplifying our vision and reach. With our sights set on 2025, we plan to raise a combination of VC and/or bank loans $200 million to construct 20 new HABs across the United States and strategic locations worldwide. Our partnerships with grocery stores flourish, and we will expand our impact and influence on the food industry. We anticipate the launch of our inaugural project with NASA and Above Space, a testament to our prowess in innovation and cutting-edge technology. By signing contracts for 45 new Container Gardens, we will make a resounding statement about the future of sustainable agriculture. After celebrating a full year of operation for our Huntsville HAB, our vision will extend to new revenue streams, including the sale of HABs to third parties, carbon capture endeavors, and a promising collaboration with NASA in the realm of space. By 2026, our focus shifts toward operating with precision and excellence, optimizing every facet of our endeavors. This sets the stage for 2027, when we embark on the next phase of our journey: the pursuit of an exit strategy that honors our mission, our investors, and our relentless pursuit of redefining urban farming. Together, with a dedicated team and steadfast commitment to sustainability and innovation, we at Shipshape Urban Farms are on a mission to cultivate a greener, more nourished future for all. Our container gardens, HABs, and pioneering partnerships are but the beginning of a groundbreaking era in sustainable agriculture. Join us in sowing the seeds of change and watch as we transform cities into vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystems of growth, health, and prosperity.
