Vouchers act as a collective mind in order to determine whether to approve loans or not. Each voucher approval serves like an insurance of the loan capped at $10 USD per borrower. In order for the loan to be approved, the entire loan amount should be guaranteed by the big pool of vouchers.

When you put on your VR headset and come to our virtual Zen dojo we make meditation as clear and structured as possible with our research backed curriculum. The fully immersive qualities of virtual reality allow us to bring our students to a separate space for meditation. No clutter still sitting in front of you on your desk or todo lists in your periphery - we remove the distractions of the outside world and engage you in a dedicated, peaceful, and realistic environment - without forcing you to leave your home or alter your schedule. VR also allows us to incorporate dynamic experiences to the classroom, such as teaching on a mountain top, or in a rainstorm, or with metaphorical tools like clouds floating by to represent thoughts. Things you could never achieve in real life! Unlike existing meditation phone apps,  we don’t just provide temporary relaxation; we teach with a focus on education, growth, and how to apply what you learn to your everyday life. Actual, practical, techniques, mindsets, and philosophies to use outside of virtual reality. We have a developed product launched on Oculus App Lab, Oculus Rift, and Steam VR marketplaces and initial traction with hundreds of paying customers in the first few months. We’re developing partnerships with key VR headset distributors and other wellness companies. And the Georgia Tech master’s thesis research backing ZenVR’s design has been accepted for publication at an industry defining conference this spring.

For every 100 high school students in Bangladesh, only 20 get promoted to college, and from there, only 7 get into universities. One of the top 3 reasons for such a low conversion is the 1:60 teacher-student ratio in schools. Moreover, 80% of quality teachers are clustered in the urban areas. As a result, a 2 Billion Dollar local Market for after school teaching is created, that is expected to hit 30 Billion in South Asia by 5 years. To solve this huge crisis of teachers, “Online Sohopathi” (www.sohopathi.io) comes into the picture. We have created a social learning platform, where students can get solutions to all their problems by interacting with the best mentors, all over the country. Using the newsfeed of our digital platform, mentors can upload or share all types of academic information or free learning contents & build their own student community. Our smart recommendation system suggests students with their suitable contents and mentors, for all their personal learning needs.

By applying its innovative ultra-thin and durable coating solutions, DropWise serves enormous markets that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies. Heat exchangers are a crucial part of every thermal fluid system, from the intercoolers and radiators used to cool cars and trucks, to the condensers and evaporators that drive HVAC/R equipment, to the massive boilers and condensers that drive manufacturing processes and power plants. They rely on very thin heat transfer surfaces that are extremely sensitive to fouling and corrosion, which creates a process bottleneck and forces operators to either reduce output capacity, consume more energy to compensate, or shut down completely to clean the affected heat exchanger.  For all of these problems, conventional liquid-based anti-fouling and anti-corrosion coatings are too thick, and often make the problem worse by insulating the heat transfer surfaces. Faced with this unacceptable performance tradeoff, the status quo is to leave the equipment uncoated and to bear the significant costs of the fouling and corrosion that inevitably occur. Using an innovative vapor-based deposition process, DropWise coatings are chemically grafted to virtually any surface and built up to precise thicknesses. The chemical grafting provides an extremely durable bond that has surpassed testing under severe industrial conditions, and the coating thicknesses can be tuned to nanometer precision to be hundreds of times thinner than conventional coatings. DropWise has secured a license to the MIT patent applications, and is developing a coating platform built from a wide library of precursor materials to address different applications. Low surface energy coatings are used to break up insulating films of condensate into droplets, enabling a 7x increase in heat transfer that allows the coating to boost the efficiency of a wide range of processes, from steam power generation and desalination to HVAC/R and chemical processing; while another chemically inert formulation is used to protect against corrosive environments.",,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",5,"Adam Paxson, Colin Gounden, David Borrelli, Karen Gleason, Kripa Varanasi",11-50,8,,2017-11-16,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,2794000,USD,2794000,4577837,USD,4577837,"MassChallenge, National Science Foundation, Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, Henkel Ventures, NXT Ventures",3,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,1,0,Layered Products,,,,

Users can effortlessly create and support new startups across all borders, and participate in transparent, flexible and fair financing round regardless of being a crypto or non-crypto startup. The problem The startup investment industry is largely lead by Venture capitalists and institutional investors, they can leverage their capital, using network and connections as well as their brand, able to negotiate better investment conditions to make substantial ROI. The majority of those deals are conducted in a closed and private environment. Retail investors don't typically have access to these kinds of deals. For example, if you invested in Coinbase seed round, there would have been 5000X ROI. By the time of listing, VC's have already made a substantial investment and token unlock schedules, often deter smaller investors. Most recently, retail Investors are more attracted to democratic funding method, some Startups have considered the ""Fairlaunch"" funding method for that reason. However, Fair Launch is not a practical method to release a token, let alone fund a business. It's unreasonable to expect adoption from mass-retail investors and for them to provide not only funding, but also connections and marketing, a core part of what VCs provide today, which is often worth just as much as capital to a project. Now, democratic and practical startup investment approach is demanded, to bring more competitiveness and innovation to startup industry. How will DAOLaunch solve this problem? Our solution at DAOLaunch is to offer an open and competitive environment - the Decentralized Venture Capital concept. DAOLaunch offers preferential investment conditions depending on their investment performance recorded on the blockchain. Recorded investment platforms are not editable, DAOLaunch investors can brand themselves as Decentralized Venture Capitalists and they can negotiate investment terms like traditional VC firms do these days. We aim to change the structure of closed investment deals to an open and more competitive deal structure that takes place on the blockchain. This will drastically expand the startup industry. Highly Functional Financial Product Creation Platform and Grant System DAOLaunch provides a highly functional and comprehensive financial product creation platform. This platform enables anyone to seamlessly create and support new products in financial markets across all borders, regardless of its status as a crypto or non-crypto startup. No coding knowledge is required - easily build new financial products that have real demand. The DAOLaunch grant system called the IBO (Initial Buy-Back Offering) is a brand new concept of a reimagined standard of startup launch methodology. The grant process is conducted by a fully decentralize voting process where the native tokens of selected startups are directly purchased through a Buy-Back system from DAOLaunch after they're listed on the market using our allocated grant. The tokens purchased through our Buy-Back automatically burn. We secure the best investment conditions for the Decentralized Venture Capital ecosystem through blockchain technologies. We are a pioneer in shaping a new market On DAOLaunch, you can mint decentralized venture capital NFTs (DVC-NFT), vote, and record the investment performance on blockchain, whilst negotiating better investment terms. DVC-NFTs also allows you to create your own token index portfolio as an NFT. Users can deposit their seed tokens in the contract like a VC entity on NFT. Trade/Lend VC portfolio on the NFT marketplace Create your VC portfolio as an NFT. Trade or lend your VC portfolio to earn capital or interest without losing ownership of it. Until now, the funds invested into startups could not be used effectively until the lockup period was over. But with the DVC-NFT, even when the token is locked you can make a profit by trading or lending the DVC-NFT itself.

Smart Yields is building relationships through a groundbreaking analytics system powered by the people who know it best – our farmers. We connect farmers, agricultural researchers and their communities through crowd-sourced data gathered from a network of integrated sensors that measure everything from soil health to inputs such as water, energy and nutrients. In turn, these users tap into a vast wealth of local, regional and national knowledge to increase productivity, yield, and revenue. Our inspiration is the ahupua‘a, a traditional land division in Hawaii that stretches from the mountains to the ocean, containing the many important resources needed for the communities within. Hawaii, home to our global headquarters, is committed to doubling its food production by 2030. We see significant unmet needs here and around the world, as well as great potential in empowering ‘agripreneurs’ – the aspiring, growing farmer.  Today, thanks to visionaries in the field, we are seeing more interest than ever before. Investment in U.S. agriculture technology reached over $700 million in 2017, more than the previous two years combined.  At Smart Yields, we’re using this momentum to think big by thinking small (to medium), using farm-to-screen technologies to enhance your farm-to-table experience.  Our globally recognized team was part of the sixth cohort of the Blue Startups accelerator program; selected for the 2017 cohort of the Elemental Excelerator; and was one of nine companies from around the world to present in the inaugural Laudato Si’ Challenge tech accelerator in Rome.

For semiconductor companies and electronic device manufactures with stringent requirements in terms of safety and security, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware provides secure boot, device attestation, remote firmware updates, telemetry, real-time monitoring, and scalable secure communications. Unlike traditional firmware, which is built as a monolithic blob of trusted and untrusted functionality, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware is completely self-contained and isolated from the rest of the system thanks to the underlying Hex Five’s patented MultiZone® TEE technology. With Hex Five, companies throughout the semiconductor value chain benefit from stronger security, reduced development costs, times and risks, and the flexibility to safely integrate readily available multi-sourced hardware and software components. PATENTED TECHNOLOGY Securing embedded devices has become increasingly difficult as complex new requirements are often met with the addition of readily available 3 rd party components that cannot always be trusted. Most embedded devices lack the hardware resources to provide the necessary separation, thus leading to larger attack surface and increased system vulnerability. To shield critical functionality from untrusted third-party components, Hex Five has designed, developed, and patented MultiZone® Security, a truly innovative Trusted Execution Environment providing hardware-enforced software-defined separation of multiple functional domains within the same chip. Complexity is the enemy of security. To simplify the development process, and to minimize the risk for human error, MultiZone encapsulates and hides the complexity of managing the underlying hardware security blocks exposing their functionality as a set of policies. The only interaction between the developer and Hex Five’s Trusted Execution Environment is a simple policy definition file.

As the global demand for coffee increases, so do coffee plantations — destroying rainforests at a critical rate. Recent research from WWF ranks coffee as number 6 on the list of leading causes of deforestation. In collaboration with the University of Amsterdam, we’re currently getting to the bottom of this; investigating the deeper consequences of increasing coffee production. The first results are alarming. We enjoy our daily shot of energy at the expense of our planet’s biodiversity. Over the years, we’ve seen beautiful initiatives such as the stimulation of organic plantations or increasing the coffee yield per hectare. However, the reality is that in order to really combat deforestation, these evolutions are not enough. As food technologists succeed to make meat without animals, we asked ourselves: can we make coffee without beans? What if we could make our favourite elixir from local ingredients? Coffee is a unique gift of nature. Whether you adore your filter coffee at home, prefer a barista’s cappuccino or an Italian espresso at the bar — nothing should change about those delicious moments. As true explorers, we’re on a quest to research all components in all edible non-tropical plants. From our lab at the World Food Center, we work in close collaboration with Wageningen University & Research and our leading food technology partners to find answers to our big question: what molecules are promising building blocks to mimic that signature coffee flavour?  In the coming years, we’ll pour ourselves into developing a delicious cup of coffee, indistinguishable from what you’re currently enjoying.",https://www.facebook.com/Northern-Wonder-111121614489405,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food and Beverage,4,"Andreas Giel, Bas Franse, David Klingen, Onno Franse",1-10,1,Seed,2022-05-31,1000000,EUR,1073412,Pre-Seed,1000000,EUR,1073412,Pre-Seed,1000000,EUR,1073413,1000000,EUR,1073413,"Rabobank, OostNL",,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,
