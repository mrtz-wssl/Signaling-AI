However, we strongly believe that there is an opportunity to rethink this matter. Yornest offers a fresh approach to how mass communication is handled for member-based communities. Say goodbye to the old-fashioned, one-size-fits-all approach and embrace a new era of streamlined, efficient, and engaging communication. Traditional SMS & email channels for member-based communities is a one-sided conversation that often inundates users with generic messages, leaving them feeling disconnected and bombarded. At Yornest, we believe in a more meaningful approach. Our innovative community communication app empowers community managers to transform SMS & emails marketing into a two-way dialogue. Imagine sending SMS or email alerts that not only convey your message but also drive the recipients to engage in a community feed where they can discuss, ask questions, and share their thoughts in real-time. It's time to bid farewell to one-way SMS & email blasts and embrace a more interactive and engaging communication method that fosters genuine connections. At Yornest, we deeply appreciate that the vitality of any community is intricately linked to the quality of its interactions and conversations. This profound understanding has led us to revolutionize the way community managers harness the potential of SMS and email channels as a means of communication, seamlessly integrating them into a dynamic community feed. Unlike traditional approaches, our community feed transcends being a mere one-way communication tool; it serves as the pulsating epicenter of engagement. Our innovative platform empowers users to leverage posts from the feed as text alerts or emails, effectively transforming every interaction into an opportunity for fostering meaningful dialogue.

This long sought-after approach has potential to treat a range of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders including ones that would otherwise be difficult to treat. Alivio has exclusive rights to a proprietary inflammation-targeting technology, based on the research of Dr. Karp (BWH/HMS) and Dr. Robert Langer (MIT), which is the first technology to reproducibly show the ability to target immunomodulatory compounds to inflamed tissue, which can lead to dramatic improvements in treatment efficacy with major reductions in systemic effects. The platform has been validated in multiple labs and preclinical models of inflammation, including models where the inflammation occurred in different parts of the body (e.g., the GI system, the bladder, joints, skin, etc.). The technology could potentially be used with a variety of medications (e.g., small molecules, biologics, and nucleic acids) both independently or in combination, and is designed to be administered orally or via other routes.
