The virtual scenarios can be validated through virtual reality training where workers go immersively inside the new manufacturing scenarios and execute the new optimized production tasks for efficient implementation of improved production processes. The 3D gamification technology for production management allows industry to keep plants operating while they are monitored remotely and/or in teleworking.

Best I've used by a mile"" - J.K. Rowling ""Let me tell you, if you do have trouble sleeping, try it, because it really works."" -His Royal Highness, The Duke of York “Give Pzizz a try! Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” -Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify Featured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more! PRESS MENTIONS “…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated “That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times “Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker HOW IT WORKS Pzizz delivers sleep at the push of a button! Using the science of psychoacoustics (see our website for in-depth details), the app's patented system plays you ""dreamscapes""— a sleep-optimized mix of music, voiceover, and sound effects that changes each night, to quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed. If you want to sleep better at night or take incredible power naps during the day, this is the app for you! All you have to do is listen to Pzizz. Headphones/earbuds are recommended for optimal effectiveness, but your built-in phone speaker will work too. NAP MODULE Napping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your well-being with a 10-20 minute nap. FOCUS MODULE The focus module is music designed to help you get more work done. Built around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes. Each focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently. WHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER?  *Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep.  *No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects. *Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time. *Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and voice gender for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health! *Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated. Read more about the science behind Pzizz at blog.pzizz.com. THE DETAILS MATTER  Our sleep researchers work closely with our audio engineers to create beautiful dreamscapes that are backed by academic psycho-acoustics, and we pair these musical dreamscapes with voice scripts based on clinical sleep interventions, and then infuse them with personalization driven through our learning algorithms so you have a different audio sequence each night (which is important to keep Pzizz effective over time). It’s wild, and incredibly potent.

Then, with a business analytic layer, matching data is run through algorithms to make recommendations both efficiently and timely.  The team has spent 10 years on the ground manually matching health system and insurance data directly with patients to make prudent recommendations around better quality and lower-cost healthcare. For the first time, due to interoperability and patient access regulations, we are compiling methodologies that draw on both parts of the system to make for a better patient experience.  // MILESTONES 2018 - Started R&D and Customer Discovery 2020 - Met with Health and Human Services (CMS/CCIIO Innovation Day) about interoperability/patient access 2021 - Participated in Ben Franklin Techcelerator 2021 - Participated in Pennsylvania Insurance Department Keystone Quickstart Program 2021 - Received Ben Franklin Grant 2022 - Filed as B-Corp 2022 - Rolling out MVP later this year //PLATFORM FOCUSES Cover - Before the cost of healthcare can be driven down, the needs of 160 million consumers who don't have access to employer coverage must have an objective source to get care. SnapHealth algorithms use health history, active medication lists, and income reporting to screen for prudent solutions and allow them to enroll right within the system. Compare - Between Health Equity, Rural Health needs, and Seniors with Caregivers trying to manage aging in place, SnapHealth will provide independent guidance on the most efficient methods to navigate healthcare. A patient must consider health networks, medical vendors, medication manufacturers, and programs available from their insurance, hospital, and government. SnapHealth will help sift through these programs and give patients access to tools ranging from Case Manager offers to Social Determinants of Health Programs. This is crucial when more seniors are aging in place. Response - As an untethered platform, the patient decides who and what can use their data. With deidentified records, we are looking to aggregate data in ways that would improve outcomes between the Opioid Crisis, Pandemic Response, AI interpretation of clinician natural language, and Clinical trials by using macro-level datasets. Outcomes - Feeds from NIH and other resources within trade groups and trusted health systems will advise patients on preventative care recommendations and outstanding screenings that are shown to be missing from the patient data on the platform. Circle - governance policies allow extended family, immediate family, and caregivers different levels of access and/or notices per your specific direction. Patients decide who knows what, and when. SnapHealth manages compliance and matching programs to ensure patient data is protected and shared ONLY at the direction of the owner of the data: the Individual.

Once the adoption request has been sent, users will be able to access their own private area where they will be able to monitor the status of their request (online form accepted/rejected, the face-to-face meeting passed/rejected, adoption accepted/rejected). In addition to this, Empethy offers a personalized online consultation service in order to provide an array of useful tips and advice aimed at ""preparing"" the future adopter for a conscious and responsible adoption of the future dog/ cat. On the other hand, animal shelters, rescue groups, volunteers can upload their adoption ads easily and quickly by filling out a standardized online form containing all the information needed for a conscious adoption decision (e.g. personal data, vaccinations/castrations, special needs, pathologies, etc.). Once created their own profiles, associations will be able to access their private area, where they will be able to manage all incoming requests (accept/reject the online form, accept/reject face-to-face meeting, accept/reject adoption) for each individual pet in a more standardized and automated way. Empethy's mission is to encourage responsible pet adoption in order to ensure a long-term relationship between humans and animals and prevent the abandonment of other animals.

Current sound creation and reproduction technologies are decades old. Most recently, the introduction of “spatial” or “3D” audio fails to deliver authentic spatial context. With its patented InSitu Sound (TM) technology, Scaeva is changing the foundations of sound and redefining how we listen, create and relate to content. SPATIAL CONTEXT IS CRITICAL for naturally immersive experiences. Without it VR, AR, music, home theater and gaming experiences are pale shadows of what they could be.  Unlike 360, 3D, or binaural audio, InSitu Sound enables sound field shaping in any direction, at any depth, and doesn’t require specially recorded content to give listeners an immersive experience. InSitu Sound unlocks the acoustic context behind the source content, meaning you get the full depth of the audio experience the artist intended.
