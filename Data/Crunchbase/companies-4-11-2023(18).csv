In other words, data owners can share files through any method (e.g., email, cloud or USB drive) and the protection stays with the data wherever it goes, in perpetuity. At data owner's discretion, policies for data access can be modified or entirely revoked, allowing for dynamic protection, even after the data has left your environment. With policies based on factors including user, geolocation, time, device, and more, even if files are lost, data stays protected, ultimately making data breaches irrelevant.  Selected Keyavi features: • Protect files and control who has access to them dynamically, even after they are shared • Maintain protection of any copies of files  • Gain visibility into the entire lifecycle of Keyavi-protected data via chain of custody details • Send and open Keyavi-enabled emails using the Microsoft Outlook plugin • Prevent screen capture and video recording of documents • Revoke access from previously shared data • Allow access by authorized locations and users • Set a time limit for when access to the data access begins and expires • Exclude access from black-listed countries • Protect specific directories automatically with Intelligent Directory™",,Western US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Privacy and Security",2,"Elliot Lewis, Todd Demko",11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,2022-08-03,13000000,USD,13000000,Series A,13000000,USD,13000000,Series A,21300000,USD,21300000,21300000,USD,21300000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2022-02-28,,,,13,1,,7,,,,,,,

Central to the business’ investment plans is an equity commitment of $600m led by Warburg Pincus, the global private equity house. They bring more than 50 years’ experience in growth investment to Trident, having supported over 800 companies with more than $60bn of equity. The team at Trident Energy is one of the industry’s most experienced in the science of operating and redeveloping mid-life oil and gas assets. It considers fields that are no longer central to their owners’ strategic goals but can still deliver growth by applying fresh thinking, specialist mid-life experience and technology. With forensic attention to detail, the teams re-interpret subsurface data and leverage the existing infrastructure to redevelop and re-energise fields. Activities range from well-work and drilling to near-field exploration. Trident Energy’s vision is to build a geographically diversified portfolio of sizable and producing mid-life oil and gas assets located onshore and offshore, redeveloping and operating them to world-class standards. The group is primarily focused on Africa and Latin America but is open to opportunities in Europe and Asia.  The first acquired assets were successfully taken over from Hess Corporation in 2017. The Okume and Ceiba fields are located in both shallow and deep water in the Rio Muni basin of Equatorial Guinea. At the time of the takeover, the asset was producing 42,000 barrels of oil per day. In just a matter of months, Trident Energy had already increased output by 24% and is continuing to enhance production. The group’s plan in Equatorial Guinea not only delivered initial gains but also outlines years of future cost-effective production increases. To extend the life of fields, the existing infrastructures are leveraged. Complex operating challenges are managed to enable redevelopment and exploration. The focus is then on increasing production and creating new reserves. The Trident Energy team draws on years of field experience and best-in-class reservoir management skills to deliver its plans and create value for all its stakeholders. Trident Energy invests every year to support local projects in Equatorial Guinea. These include a community involvement programme supporting schools, healthcare and skills development, and alongside other companies in the sector, a national institute for technology to train young people in the skills they need to work in the energy industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Natural Resources",,,51-100,1,Private Equity,2016-12-12,500000000,USD,500000000,Private Equity,500000000,USD,500000000,Private Equity,500000000,USD,500000000,500000000,USD,500000000,Warburg Pincus,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-69.5%,40,,,,,,,,,,

We do this through fractional ownership of rare sneakers. Say goodbye to waiting in long lines for hype drops, or fighting bots online to get your hands on those desirable shoes you can flip for a profit. Rares makes it easy. You buy shares in the shoe instead of buying the shoe.   Here is how it works:  LEARN:   You may already be savvy about sneaker culture and shoes, which is awesome. However, we feature shoes on our platform that have specific attributes and stories that make them valuable. We will educate you on these stories through our videos and other tools, so you can truly understand the value of what you are investing in.  Investing not your thing? Don't worry we got you! We explain all the necessary investing terms so you only have to focus on your knowledge of shoe culture to make a smart investment.   BUY:  We release our shoes on our app through Initial Public Offerings (IPO). That means we make fractional shares of the shoe available for the first time for you to buy. You can buy this and hold it until we sell the shoe and cash in on the potential profits, or you can trade them with other users on our app after the IPO closes.  TRADE:   Once the IPO closes, you can always sell your shares to other buyers who missed out on the initial drop! No need to hold on to your shares forever! What is even better is that the shares may be worth more after the drop and you can choose to take your profits. You could also hold on to the shares until we decide to sell the shoe and then you potentially profit off the increase in price. Missed out on the drop, you can also buy shares from someone looking to sell theirs. Either way, it is up to you. Our platform makes it easier than ever to match buyers and sellers.   ENGAGE:   Whether you are actively trading or not, we welcome you to come on our platform to engage in a community of like-minded users. You can follow other investors, like comment, and react to relevant posts around sneakers. We think it is important to not feel like you are the only one in the room on a trading platform and we know sneakers and community go hand in hand. So please hang out and stay a while! So what are you waiting for? Stop watching from the sidelines! Invest in the culture!   DISCLAIMER:  This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities, or open a brokerage account on the Rares Platform. The Rares platform, 370 Legacy, inc and 370 Legacy Markets, does not recommend any securities. All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.

All vulnerability information gleaned from any assessment or test is added to a growing collection of intelligence that is stored in our data lake and shared amongst the solutions.

Yieldstreet,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yieldstreet,2015-01-05,day,"Finance, Financial Services, FinTech, Wealth Management","New York, New York, United States",Yieldstreet is an alternative investments platform that provides retail investors with access to income-generating investment products.,"26,776",$50M to $100M,Active,,,,,For Profit,http://www.yieldstreet.com,https://twitter.com/Yieldstreet,https://www.linkedin.com/company/yieldstreet-inc,"Yieldstreet is a management platform that provides institutional investors with access to income-generating investment products. Founded in 2015, Yieldstreet gives individuals access to alternative investments that have traditionally been off-limits to the average investor. With over $2.5 billion invested across multiple asset classes, Yieldstreet is changing the way people generate passive income by lowering and removing the barriers that historically kept these lucrative opportunities far out of reach.  In 2013, founders Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz were frustrated that many investment strategies were typically reserved only for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Typically, the average investor was left to choose between the stock market and bonds with falling yields - with few options in between. Asset-based investments had longer hold periods and a higher barrier of entry, keeping them well out of reach of accredited investors — even more so for unaccredited investors. As a result, they decided to leverage the growing fintech disruption to give more people access to these previously restricted alternative investments.  Milind’s background in building companies, combined with Michael’s decade-plus experience within investing and fund management, formed the core of Yieldstreet. Passion for their investors and employees, as well as a willing embrace of innovation, has been part of Yieldstreet’s identity from the beginning. Each decision to leverage a new technology, investment strategy, or originate a new deal is made with the goal of putting investors first.  That drive has propelled Yieldstreet across all 50 states, crossing $100M invested in less than eight quarters, with the $1B milestone coming only three years later. In 2019, Yieldstreet’s membership had grown to 100,000, and a savings account for members was launched.  Yieldstreet, since its launch in 2015, has not deviated from its goal to change investing for the better, nor has it slowed down. Yieldstreet was ranked as number 46 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies and has been recognized by Built In as one of the Best Places to Work. Yieldstreet today delivers wealth generation options and alternative investments for more than 330,000 investors and has returned more than $1.3 billion in principal/interest.  Many alternative investment platforms only focus on one asset class, such as real estate or art. Yieldstreet’s offerings, accessed through cash or a low-fee IRA, cover a wide range of asset classes — art, real estate, legal, corporates, consumer, and commercial, via single investments or funds. Yieldstreet also offers its members short-term notes on offerings with a hold period between 3 and 6 months, which generally boast higher interest rates than money markets and CDs.  Yieldstreet is headquartered in New York and has offices in Brazil, Greece, and Malta. Michael Weisz serves as President and Milind Mehere serves as CEO. Together, they manage a team of more than 140 employees, all working toward Yieldstreet’s one goal: change the way people invest for the better.",https://www.facebook.com/Yieldstreet,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,Financial Services,3,"Dennis Shields, Michael Weisz, Milind Mehere",101-250,8,Late Stage Venture,2022-08-10,400000000,USD,400000000,Debt Financing,50000000,USD,50000000,Series C,228500000,USD,228500000,728500000,USD,728500000,"Gaingels, Monroe Capital, FJ Labs, Transform Capital, Soros Fund Management",8,17,2,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2023-05-10,,3,12.64%,71,1,,44,,,,,771189,USD,771189

LABEL team builds up an ecosystem that establishes an incubating system, that will purport to provide an easier access to investment / promotion / distribution and improve an unfair profit structure that exists in the current sphere, striving to prevent copyright infringement cases across the industry. The pillars that will be developed inside of the LABEL Value Chain ecosystem are as following: Incubating System   The core idea behind the “Incubating System” is that anyone can register their digital course related to the career or job training and education inside of the LABEL. For the course to be eligible for the listing on the platform, it has to go through the voting system, where the votes are governed by the users and the selection process is carried out according to their votes. Once the selection process is over, the selected course will be provided with the investments in LBL tokens, that are contributed by either partner sales platforms, consumers or individual investors.  Settlement System through the usage of NFT and Smart Contracts   The courses, that have successfully received investments, will be registered as an NFT standard, which will clearly illustrate the share ratio of the ownership according to the contributions of instructors, voters and investors. The information on sales revenue from partner platforms will be released on the NFT Page, and the revenue generated by the course will be accurately distributed based on the NFT Equity Ratio that is registered in the Smart Contract.   NFT Market   The Course Creator, as well as the voters and inventors that have participated in the incubating process, including the selling platform itself and publicist can sell or trade their NFT share ratio in the NFT Market.

This unique banking experience maintains purpose and connection with the user's money plan or budget with each transaction.  This fundamentally changes the users' relationship with money resulting in greater savings and the consistent achievement of goals. The app modernizes the outdated envelope budgeting system of previous generations by digitizing budgets into “qubes”. Consumers then set limits for different qube budgets, like groceries, clothing, and entertainment.  A physical Qube Money debit card gives shoppers access to their pre-budgeted qube funds. This unique budgeting app helps consumers avoid overspending. When money in a qube is insufficient, shoppers are empowered to make in-the-moment budgeting choices about a purchase. The app is engineered to support a variety of budgeting dynamics in the household. Couples can choose Qube Companion Cards to strengthen financial transparency and keep open communication about shared budgets. Qube Money also offers an effective tool for families to track spending across different family members. With the help of Kid Cards, parents and children learn about responsible spending habits together.  FREEING people from the tyranny of money by breaking the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and eliminating personal debt is the heart of Qube Money.

So, we’ve combined the insights of educational experts and professional musicians with advanced AI technology to create a truly innovative learning tool. That’s why we offer a structured Learn Path alongside tailored practice plans, daily guitar workouts, a large song library, and interactive jam sessions.  We tackle playing guitar from every angle because that’s how confident, versatile guitarists are made.
