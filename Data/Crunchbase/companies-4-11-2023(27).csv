The company seeks to bring a series of breakthrough medical devices to worldwide markets, leveraging a patent-pending, disruptive technology called Coaptive Ultrasound which is owned by the company. Its devices reduce healthcare costs and improve safety, quality, patient experience, and access to services around the globe. Invented by Dr. Tropello, CoapTech delivers a novel platform technology combining magnetic attraction for device placement guidance, and low-cost, point-of-care ultrasound for visual feedback in diagnostic, interventional, and therapeutic procedures. Strong rare-earth magnets are used to manually guide devices placed inside the human body, while real-time, low-cost ultrasound provides visual feedback to the clinician to ensure safety. This platform technology, invented by the company founder, has the potential to disrupt multiple medical procedures, substantially reducing costs while improving safety and patient experience. Their lead use case, selected because of its low risk, clear FDA pathway, and strong commercial viability, is for the insertion of gastrostomy tubes.

The company works with hundreds of resellers and serves thousands of operators globally, including one of the world’s largest attraction theme parks, major event venues and boat tours, some of the world’s most-visited museums, and attractions like CitySightseeing/Gray Line New York, Boston Harbor Cruises, National Geographic Encounter: Ocean Odyssey, and the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum.",https://www.facebook.com/RedeamConnectivity/,"Greater Denver Area, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Internet Services, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism",4,"Alex Kremer, Kevin Mclaughlin, Leith Stevens, Nathan Probst",11-50,1,Early Stage Venture,2018-03-05,7700000,USD,7700000,Series A,7700000,USD,7700000,Series A,7700000,USD,7700000,7700000,USD,7700000,"JetBlue Ventures, Thayer Ventures, Vertical Venture Partners, Cobre Capital, Peninsula Ventures",1,10,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51,,,26,,,,,,,

Privileged account access represents the keys to the kingdom for threat actors, enabling them to move around a network almost unabated. With it, attackers can explore and extract as much sensitive data as they like. These same privileged accounts then allow the threat actor to encrypt that same stolen data and hold the organization at ransom. Identifying all potential attack paths in large and dynamic environments is impossible using manual methods. Finding, quantifying and prioritizing where to start and what to do requires automation. Defenders can never hope to get ahead of attackers if attackers have a better understanding of the battlefield - the organizations own network. By leveraging the same techniques used by threat actors to visualize the most critical paths to critical resources, defenders can start to see their environment as attackers do.

It is a frictionless, non-invasive, early detection, remote disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic measurement modality. nQ uses an artificial intelligence company to develop computational biomarkers that have been proven in five years of clinical trials to substantially change the way disease is managed for a wide range of neuromotor and neurocognitive disorders (Alzhemer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, concussion, et al. The platfomr focuses on analysis of user interaction with common electronic devices to capture functional decline related to neurodegenerative disorders. The fine control of typing and touch screen kinematics together with the frequent use of electronic devices allows for precise monitoring of small changes in neurodegeneration that frequently go unnoticed by clinicians. nQ allows for early detection of disease, 24/7, passive, at home, remote monitoring of disease progression and the measurement of impact of therapy at a fraction of the cost of current gold standards. There is no required task. Just use your device as your would normally use it. Of note, as one of the company's medical advisors, Zoltan Mari, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic, so aptly quoted: ""As important as it is to fund novel compounds for treating diseases, it is also important to set the stage for maximum impact when those compounds are discovered and approved for use. It is impossible to find a cure without early detection. That's why drug candidates fail. When the FDA puts its stamp on the first disease modifying drugs, such early detection technologies will be instantly necessary."" He goes on to state further: ""We also need a disease progression marker. Nothing so far has managed to do very well (while being profoundly expensive). Much of our research and clinical interest is turning toward disease progression. All efforts should focus on readying and perfecting early detection tools and building effective, reliable, inexpensive ways of tracking disease and the impact of therapy over time.” nQ is that early detection, disease progression computational biomarker.",,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Mark Pascarella, Richie Bavasso",11-50,5,Seed,2021-11-16,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,4450000,USD,4450000,4450000,USD,4450000,"XLerateHealth, PharmStars, DigiTx Partners, GSK NEXT, Bob Saunders",3,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,4,,,,,,,,,

Klassroom caters specifically to educator needs while offering the level of engagement and ease-of-use found in the most widely used online social platforms. When a teacher starts to use the app in one classroom, other teachers in the school join in very quickly and easily. Teachers can create a new class in just minutes, and they invite parents to access posts in the class feed including announcements, homework, videos, pictures of activities, polls, events, documents, and more. Klassroom’s level of parent engagement is outstanding: more than 90% are monthly active users. Parents can react to posts, contact the teacher for appointments, or initiate private conversations using tools that are designed to strengthen parent-teacher relationships while protecting the teacher’s time. Klassroom can translate all posts and private messages between parent and teacher into 100 different languages, and Klassroom can also accommodate the visually impaired. Every parent or guardian can be involved — even across multiple households. Klassroom co-founders Frank-David Cohen and Damien Rottemberg have been friends since childhood and planned that one day they would build something together to make a positive difference in the world. That opportunity came in 2016 when both were divorced dads who found themselves distanced from the education of their children and wanting to be better connected. In Paris and New York respectively, Frank-David and Damien provided the first Klassroom app prototype to the teachers of their young children.

We help companies transform their business infrastructure into a confidential computing environment. Enclaive is a pioneering Confidential Cloud Compute Technology company protecting Data in Use. Enclaive's business-enabling and data-processing capabilities for secure data search, sharing, and collaboration protect data while it's being used or processed – the 'holy grail' of computing on encrypted data and the 'missing puzzle piece' to bring the remaining 80% of workload to the cloud. Enclaive is revolutionising cloud computing by addressing a Data in Use vulnerability of cloud computing that people have been looking for more than 2 decades. Have you ever considered to move to a public cloud to exploit reduced costs, CAPEX to OPEX shifts, and managed deployment; however encountered challenges like ""What happens to the data? Is the cloud trustworthy? Is it compliant with existing regulations like GDPR, data privacy shield, etc,?"". Enclaive's Confidential Containers are a revolutionary new technology enabling businesses to turn a public cloud with all the named benefits into a private cloud. At any moment in time, data in use is concealed. Notably, even the cloud provider can't see it. A confidential container acts like an envelope. It enclaves the data processing and storing. Deploying confidential containers helps developers to build for the very first time zero-trust applications and cloud infrastructures, stretching the band of what is possible with data processing today. Thereby businesses retain the sovereignty over data and data processing activities.  Confidential Containers are the right choice for businesses developing data-driven services in the cloud. Enclaive's containers are a win-win for both data providers and data processors. Data processors do not learn the data, as it is enclaved, though gaining insights from the data is possible. Vice versa, data owners may also execute the data processing on premise without learning the data processing core, protecting against IP infringement.",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",2,"Andreas Walbrodt, Sebastian Gajek",11-50,1,Seed,2023-06-13,1650000,EUR,1780290,Seed,1650000,EUR,1780290,Seed,1650000,EUR,1780291,1650000,EUR,1780291,"F-Technologies, Norbert Pohlmann, Ammar Alkassar, Ben Bumgardner",,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,24,,,,,,,,139680,USD,139680

BeneFix offers health insurance brokers a digital platform that delivers 100% accurate quotes 100 times faster. Based in Lancaster, Pa., BeneFix manages data from thousands of plans  offered by major carriers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, offering quotes in minutes from a simple-to-use online interface reminiscent of Zillow. Less than two years after founder Matt Ranauro first had the idea for the platform, the business had a brick-and-mortar office in Lancaster City, over 1,000 customers, and, most recently, became one of nine central Pennsylvania finalists competing for a $100,000 investment from AOL co-founder Steve Case’s “Rise of the Rest” initiative.  The success is due, Ranauro believes, to three factors.  First, his own passion for the product. Ranauro has co-founded several tech companies, most notably ILL Co., a company that has built apps for HBO and Nickelodeon, analytics platforms for KPMG and products for the Mayo Clinic. With each company, Ranauro needed to find health insurance for himself and his co-founders and employees. “It took about two months just to find out what was available, then get enrolled in those products.” He said. “Which seems crazy, right? In 2017?” The question became: how do we streamline this and make it a better experience for everyone? Ranauro’s previous experience is the second factor that contributes to the success and growth of BeneFix.  The final is the Insurtech industry itself.  With insurance, and health insurance particularly, still lagging behind other industries in terms of using and creating technologies that work, the Insurtech industry, a $4.5 trillion industry, has attracted the attention of venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs alike. Lancaster (Ranauro’s hometown)  may be Amish country, full of farms, buggies and country roads, but BeneFix is out to prove that it’s also fertile soil for creating a company that will revolutionize the health insurance industries’ outdated model.

Massive cloud adoption further complicates the scenario because securing the cloud is more difficult than in other environments and skilled personnel is scarce. The current methods and tools used by companies to manage their third-party risk make the process very confrontational, yet shallow and without visibility into cloud environments. Tenchi's product was developed from scratch to be based on cooperation, with a controlled sharing of security postures and maturity data between organizations that is beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Large enterprises can finally have the visibility they need to ensure that their data is properly secured whether it is in their own environments or in a third party's. Third parties gain much-needed help to improve their security postures through an automated process that greatly reduces the burdens they face dealing with endless questionnaires and audits. Plus, the product reduces information asymmetry in the ecosystem, so market forces can work to reward security-conscious third parties with more business from regulated corporate customers and higher margins.",,Latin America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",3,"Alexandre Sieira, Dani Dilkin, Felipe Boucas",11-50,1,Seed,2021-10-19,3300000,USD,3300000,Seed,3300000,USD,3300000,Seed,3300000,USD,3300000,3300000,USD,3300000,"Global Founders Capital, MAYA Capital, ONEVC, Kinea Investimentos Ltda",1,4,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36,,,,,,,,,,

Trial sponsors spend $65B every year on clinical trials and 45% of those trials fail because they are poorly designed. These failures equate to billions of dollars in lost opportunity for trial sponsors every year - but more importantly, patients don't have time to wait for us to get it right.  In the digital age, humans cannot physically read and digest every bit of information relevant to a given decision. In addition, almost every organization has what is called 'dark' or 'siloed' data – valuable data that is not being used, or that organizations don’t know they have at their disposal. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the data within a given organization is dark or siloed. As a result, pharmaceutical companies are making important decisions with incomplete information.  ENTER TRIALS.AI - we are on a mission to get effective treatments to patients faster by using artificial intelligence to optimize clinical trial designs for speed and success.  Unlike the current service models out there, we use smart technology to harness vast amounts of data that no human can process – then offer unique insights across therapeutic areas to trial sponsors.
