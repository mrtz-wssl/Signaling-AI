Our company's mission is to reinvent the use of computers and software applications through an Interactive Operating System, AL OS1, powered by a Large Action Model. The challenge at the heart of Agile Loop's mission is to democratize technology and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of proficiency with computers or specific software applications. This challenge is of paramount importance because it addresses a fundamental societal issue - the digital divide. In today's increasingly tech-dependent world, the ability to navigate and utilize computers and software efficiently is no longer a luxury but a necessity. However, a significant portion of the human population, particularly older generations and individuals with limited exposure to technology, face barriers to harnessing the full potential of these tools. By developing AL OS1, Agile Loop aims to break down these barriers and empower individuals of all backgrounds and age groups. The ability to operate computers and software applications through just natural language prompts means that anyone, regardless of their tech-savvy, can access and leverage the power of technology. This inclusivity can have a profound impact on society, bridging generational and digital divides. AL OS1's capabilities enable users to perform complex tasks with simple language prompts. This level of automation can significantly enhance productivity across various sectors, from business and finance to healthcare and education. It reduces the need for manual and repetitive tasks, allowing individuals and organizations to focus on more creative and strategic endeavors. It prioritizes inclusivity, productivity, and innovation while offering solutions to pressing societal issues.

One of our co-founders, Andrew Garcia, had a DJ business in college, and found that renting out equipment could be difficult and tedious. With his many years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, he knew he could change that. He partnered with Erik Dreyer, our other co-founder and UX extraordinaire, to build technology that made rentals easy. Their first rental marketplace was targeted at peer-to-peer rentals, but after receiving so much demand for event rentals, they transitioned to gear their rental solutions to the industry from which Andrew originally came: events. After interviewing a diverse array of event professionals, the pair realized they first must build a comprehensive software system in order to maximize the rental experience for both the vendors and the renters. They wanted to design a software program that not only did what event professionals needed it to do, but made it easy, fast and delightful along the way. With renewed focus, the duo hit the ground running. They hired our Executive Vice President, Karen Gordon, who had years of experience growing companies in both the events and technology sectors. The trio launched their SaaS platform, Goodshuffle Pro, in 2017 as a beta program and officially premiered the software at a trade show in January 2018. By 2019 the software was in 45 US states, Canada and Mexico. The company was crowned “Best Tech Startup in DC” and one of the “Coolest Places to Work” in 2020. Since then, our team, user base, and product have grown exponentially— and this is just the beginning.

We do the heavy lifting with machine learning and computer vision to ensure untrained individuals have captured the right content and that it is of a diagnosable quality prior to transmission. We have built our solution to ensure that we can capture non-adherent patients where they already are by deskilling the process and improving accessibility for the most rural, impoverished, and marginalized populations. We've made it profitable to prevent diseases for the most at-risk Americans Business Overview:  Insight Optics empowers primary care providers (PCPs) to record and refer preventative pre-screening videos to local specialists for assisted diagnostics. Our goal is to enable PCPs to efficiently detect early signs of preventable diseases before permanent damage is done. We accomplish this by providing PCPs a platform to connect and send patient data to local specialists. This allows both users to monetize otherwise unrealized referral incentives and provide better care. Problem: Over 154 million patients in the United States are recommended for an annual retinal exam, especially those with a history of diabetes or high blood pressure. Unfortunately, less than 50% of this population will receive their screening due to the difficulty of visiting a specialist, lack of education or available specialists. However, most of these patients do see PCPs annually.   Solution: We’ve developed a telemedicine PaaS, enabling PCPs to record and refer retinal exams to local specialists for assisted review. PCPs create a new revenue stream through reimbursements and government incentives. Specialists find qualified leads and increase their screening capacity without the need for in-person appointments in a non-adherent population. Benefits: The OptoView system acts as a new revenue stream for both PCPs and specialists through reimbursement. The tool satisfies HEDIS requirements for PCPs and acts as a lead generation tool for specialists to find new patients. Annual reports determine whether managed care organizations receive reimbursements or penalties from state and federal agencies. Our application is designed to satisfy the requirements for annual diabetic eye screenings, increasing an organization’s compliance rates and ophthalmologists prioritize sick patients.",,"Greater Atlanta Area, East Coast, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Health Care, Software",3,"Aaron Enten, Jermaine Fanfair, Theodore LaGrow",1-10,5,Seed,2023-08-10,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,930000,USD,930000,930000,USD,930000,"Health Wildcatters, Microsoft, Newchip, CREATE-X, TiE",4,17,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21,1,0,18,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can deliver high ROI across many applications in industry, but its widespread adoption is hampered by a lack of suitable machine learning infrastructure and the need to centralise data which in turn leads to high costs, privacy risks, overdependency on cloud platforms and network availability.   To solve these barriers to AI for Industrial IoT, T-DAB.AI are harnessing a simple but revolutionary idea. Rather than move data from Edge devices to central cloud platforms to train algorithms, move the algorithms to the data and learn at the Edge. Intelligence is achieved by combining learning on many devices via a novel technology called Federated Learning.    To deliver this, T-DAB.AI has created a decentralised AI platform for industrial IoT: OctaiPipe. OctaiPipe represents a paradigm shift in AI solving high value industrial machine intelligence use cases whilst vastly reducing costs, privacy risks, and network or cloud dependency.

Long gone are the days where hype and marketing jive alone will triumph. It is now meaning and purpose that serve as the backbone of a company’s staying power and provide the strength to remain sustainable and scalable.   Fewer than  one-third of Americans trust traditional sources of wisdom: government, media, religion and big business. This trust has eroded, particularly for millennials and Gen Zs, who now represent more than half of the U.S. population. Yet, many companies that have tried hastily to capitalize on that broken trust have only broken it further with false and inflated promises.   Now more than ever, people are seeing through the hype and massive fundraising rounds and are seeking purpose and meaning when it comes to making decisions to invest in or build a business.   In response, a new generation of companies dedicated to these principles is emerging, and gaining traction. These are the billion-dollar opportunities that will fundamentally transform the way we work, live and care for ourselves and others.   TMV has assembled a team of battle-tested operators, with proven records of spotting and amplifying inventive young companies that are bringing about this change. Our Terrain Purpose-driven founders reimagining… The Way We Work: We invest in companies that help both workers and entrepreneurs cultivate talent Logistics and Mobility: We invest in companies creating transparency and efficiency around global trade and movement Sustainable Solutions: We invest in the circular economy The Care Economy: We invest in companies broadening access to care Education Tech: We invest in companies advancing education systems   Our Commitment We make investments that reflect the way the world actually looks.  As a female-led fund with a portfolio that’s 65% women- and minority-owned, TMV represents an opportunity for a more inclusive society and culture.

With our state-of-the-art artificial intelligence solutions, fraud, waste and abuse are identified at source and inefficiencies are reduced across the board. KironAI is the most advanced and specialized AI solution in the healthcare insurance market, and our proprietary algorithms allow the platform to handle millions of complex claims with ease. By combining the techniques of AI and our extensive industry knowledge of medical claims data, Kirontech will change the way health insurance works for good. There is a growing consensus that AI technology has a vital role to play in the future of health insurance, in the elimination of fraud, waste and abuse, the streamlining and reinforcing of risk assessment processes, and in network optimization. But how? Kirontech works with extensive medical claims data, using machine learning AI to improve the bottom line of insurers, third party administrators and reinsurers, and increase quality of care through better monitoring and management of providers. KironAI uses dynamic “graph–based” learning, which means it discovers rules and patterns from within the data, rather than simply scanning for pre-specified ones; it observes, learns and adapts to new relevant patterns too complicated for the human eye to pick up. The system is ultra-fast and resilient, designed to learn even from scarce data. Kirontech is based in Cambridge, an internationally recognized technology hub. With a presence in London, the largest centre for underwriting commercial and specialty risk in the world, Kirontech is perfectly positioned to make use of its top technical and domain expertise to address the serious issues which impede the health insurance business today. But more than anything else, Kirontech is about its people. With its unique combination of skills and expertise, our team works to innovate the healthcare industry through the application of new technology that has already proved its value across many other domains.
