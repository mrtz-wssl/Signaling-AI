Plan and assign your drone fleet to flights around the world, track pilots, batteries and gear, customize safety plans and automate your compliance obligations with any country's civil aviation authority with one tool that goes wherever you fly. We have offices in the USA and Australia. The Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), which is the equivalent of the USA's FAA, selected Drone Complier as the official app to inform drone pilots where it is safe and legal to fly drones as a hobby and where you need to be certified in order to conduct commercial drone operations.  DRONE COMPLIER seamlessly links administrative control and mobile accessibility to ensure everyone involved in the company's drone operations is working from the same playbook. Administrators and risk management professionals get total visibility and ensure compliance with regulations and company policies, while operators get a valuable mission planning, logging and management app they can take anywhere they go.  Our solution was selected by the ASSURE consortium of leading US Universities (including Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University) as their official drone program management solution, and has been proven in the field in events like Embry-Riddle's Storm Chasers program, which made national headlines when students and faculty assisted first responders with real-time aerial imagery after tornados devastated Kansas. Customer testimony from Patrick Cape - Social Media and Communications Officer - Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority ""The 'Can I fly there?' app has proven to be immensely popular with the drone community in Australia, with over 20,000 users in the first week after its release. With its easy-to-understand guidance about where you can and cannot fly, 'Can I fly there?' provides every drone operator in Australia, regardless of their aviation knowledge and experience, the ability to make every flight a safe one.

In a few months, iFactory3D successfully secured partnerships with key business stakeholders: the team of high qualified engineers working on improvements of the printer and key suppliers. Additionally, the Company applied for several accelerator programs and received positive feedback from promising investors.

To date, we’ve given away nearly $100,000 in prizes & that’s taught us the importance of including the following disclosures:   If you are under the age of 12 you cannot use Rapunzl. If you are between the ages of 13-17, you may not make in-app purchases nor redeem cash prizes or other rewards unless specifically stated. Please remember that if you are a student searching for a scholarship competition, create an account using your school-verified email address to become eligible for prizes!

In locations where the minimum age for permissible use of the App is greater than 18 years of age, you represent & warrant that you meet the age requirement for the minimum age for permissible use of the App.   Even if you are over the age of 18, if you are not a legal & valid US resident, you are not eligible to receive any of Rapunzl’s competition prizes. Rapunzl’s competitions are not associated with Apple or Google Play. We may own a collection of Androids & iPhones but that’s because Rapunzl is a technology platform. We are NOT a registered investment advisor or broker-dealer and we do not provide investment advice or solicit investments.   No content in the Rapunzl app should be considered a recommendation/solicitation for the purchase or sale of investment products. There are risks associated with any investment, particularly community-based social trading.   Rapunzl hosts free competitions because we have a dream to aggregate user sentiment data & license this data to large banks & hedge funds.

The Challenge: Early lung cancer is asymptomatic. By the time it is seen on chest scans it has been in the body for years and often spreads to other organs making it very difficult to stop. If detected early, lung cancer can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy with a very high success rate. Today only 14% of lung cancers are caught early, and 84% of patients are late-detected after they experience symptoms and seek medical attention. Our Solution: Hawkeye’s LEAP (Lung Enzyme Activity Profile) diagnostic blood test quickly pre-screens the millions of people at risk for lung cancer to select the subset requiring full screening workups. This optimizes hospital resources, lowers healthcare costs, and reduces patient anxiety for greater peace of mind. LEAP can be repeated yearly as part of a regular health check-up. Our Technology: Hawkeye has developed a nanoscale protease biosensor to detect enzymatic misregulations in 18 biomarkers associated with lung cancer. When nanosensors built into the LEAP test come into contact with blood from a patient with lung cancer (any stage, any sub-type) they are detectable by Hawkeye’s machine-learning software algorithm. The LEAP workflow takes less than 2 hours and is compatible with standard molecular lab equipment.",,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,André de Fusco,1-10,2,Seed,2019-12-15,9000000,USD,9000000,Convertible Note,,,,Seed,,USD,,9000000,USD,9000000,NJF Capital,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,

We provide reliable, portable, affordable sharing power banks all over the world by locating our charging stations (kiosks) in different kind of venues (restaurants, karaokes, nightclubs, bars, etc). Our main business model is collecting revenue from powerbank rentals. Customers can use our App or WeChat to scan the QR code on the kiosks and rent a portable powerbank. The renting price differs among venues. At present, we charge customer $1 for restaurants and $2 for karaokes & nightclubs in New York (Maximum $10 per day). Also, we will profit from advertising business (kiosks, social media and app) in future since we are the first company in shared powerbank industry that has a screen on the kiosks. Our operating areas now cover New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Vancouver and Sydney. Our business is trying to solve the problem that phones are becoming necessary to everyone and people nowadays easily run out of phone battery. We will provide such kind of service that makes customers no longer get anxious about low battery phones. We have more than 15 competitors all around the world now. Most of them are in East Asia/South East Asia since that’s the origin of this type of business and all the products are manufactured there. Except competitors in the US, all other competitors have a similar business model to ours. Some of them got huge investment such as Enmonster/Laidian/Xiaodian in China and ChargeSpot in Hongkong/Japan. Competitors in the US are running a different kind of business model by selling charger or locating phone in a secured box to charge, which is not prevalent in leading market. Our clients can be separated into Consumers and Business entities. For consumers, we targeted on those people who would easily running out of phone battery. According to our research, most phones can only last for less than 8 hours after a one-time charge, which means most people have a demand of charger in the evening. For business entities, we targeted on those venues who want to have extra income and better customer service since we will share the revenue with our partner venues. Companies who want to advertise on our screen are our clients as well. Our current operating status is that we have existing product and service. After 4 months’ operation from March 2019, we find the business model works pretty good in the US market and we are even more profitable than Asian companies since our breakeven time for our kiosks (2 weeks for top venues and 6 month for restaurants) is way shorter than that in Asian market.
