We strive to offer employers a fast, effective, and drug-free solution to help their employees recover from an injury, manage chronic pain and arthritic pain, relieve muscle tension and soreness and more.   Soovu began when Drs. Charles Chabal and Peter Dunbar, board-certified physicians in pain management at the University of Washington, were personally moved by witnessing the tragedy opioids wrought on patients and their families. They challenged themselves: could there be a new, drug-free approach to treating chronic pain? With 10+ years of R&D and a $1.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the doctors created, refined and tested Soovu. The result: the only wearable using heat pulses that is clinically proven to reduce chronic, musculoskeletal and menstrual pain and is FDA registered. This rechargeable pod is at the center of our pain relief system. It emits precise heat pulses to stop the pain signal and produce a soothing effect. Attached to the pain point with a disposable adhesive, pods can be worn discreetly throughout the day.

It provides accurate, real-time indication of the product’s freshness with a tactile interface. This time and temperature response is calibrated to different food types to suit food suppliers' requirements.  Globally, a third of food produced is wasted (FAO, 2015), with 60% of it still being safe for consumption.  Mimica is creating the next generation of food expiry labelling that reduces food waste and improves safety. We project, based on previous research, that using Mimica Touch will reduce retail food waste by 50% and home waste by 60%. Based on these estimates and consumption data verified by Mintel and WRAP, we expect Mimica to save up to 13.6 million tonnes of our first three food groups (juice, milk and meat) from landfill per year in European households alone.

Typetone (former Schrijven.AI) helps brands and companies to implement generative AI organization wide to generate content and text. We help with AI text in the tone of voice and brand identity of your organization.  Organizations today rely heavily on content for their daily operations. However, creating this content can be a costly affair, especially if it has to be done on a large scale. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) now offers a solution to reduce these costs and streamline the content creation process. Nonetheless, the output of AI tools can often be generic and not match the specific style and identity of your organization or brand. Especially at scale, the use of these tools can lead to a sameness of text, and organizations (and their users) no longer recognize the brand in the text. For example, Bol.com's marketing content is very different from Coolblue's, but with tooling like ChatGPT, that distinction doesn't show up well.  This is where Typetone offers a solution. Typetone is a tool that personalizes AI output to your own or a brand's writing style. With Typetone, an organization can create content efficiently and affordably, without compromising on quality and brand identity. The result is content that is not only unique and authentic, but also reflects the tone and values of a brand.",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Sjoerd de Kreij,1-10,1,Seed,2023-03-15,205000,EUR,216926,Pre-Seed,205000,EUR,216926,Pre-Seed,205000,EUR,216926,205000,EUR,216926,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31.74%,7,,,,,,,,,,
