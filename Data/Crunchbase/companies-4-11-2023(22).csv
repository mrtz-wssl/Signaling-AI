Not so much an asset, more of a liability. With the help of e-commerce expert Rob, the pair realised that a car-sharing app (an ‘AirBnB for cars’) might offer a smarter, more environmentally friendly way for people in Britain to hire the 10 million cars rented here every year. The pair began work in August 2014, and it soon became clear that the obstacle to unlocking the value in people’s cars was simple: the keys, and the time it took to hand them over. The team worked on an app-controlled box which allowed users to unlock cars direct from the app. The QuickStart® box was born. Rob and Graeme hired their first employee in 2016, and have watched hiyacar evolve into a friendly, living community, and a company of 16 people. hiyacar still puts people first - and unlike others they were born and bred in Britain. Each hiyacar shared could take the equivalent of 11 vehicles off the road. People are getting to know their neighbours, too.

That way is Forte.","32,377",,Active,,,,,For Profit,https://www.forteofficial.com,https://www.twitter.com/forte_global,https://www.linkedin.com/company/forteglobal/,"FORTE (which stands for Financing Of Return To Employment) is a way to finance education and healthcare, at no cost to individuals or governments, and without relying on philanthropy. The FORTE approach was invented by Dr Nat Ware as part of his Oxford PhD on a Rhodes Scholarship. With the FORTE approach, the cost of high-quality education (such as retraining) and healthcare (such as cataract eye surgery) is paid for by investors. Individuals who receive these services pay nothing - either now or in the future. Instead, investors receive a portion of any increase in future taxation revenue caused by those services. Think of it as ""Future Lydia's taxes paying for Present Lydia's training"". In a nutshell, it works in three steps: 1. Via Forte, investors can pay for the services of individuals who would otherwise be paying no or negligible tax. 2. These services (such as vocational retraining), by their nature, increase expected employment, incomes, and therefore government income tax revenue. 3. Governments, as part of the contractual arrangement, pass back to investors (via Forte) an agreed portion of the tax revenue attributable to the training recipients, for a set period of time. This arrangement is mutually beneficial.  Individuals receive training at no cost and with no risk. They just pay the usual tax rate. They’re effectively paying for their own training with their future tax. Governments pay nothing upfront. They can increase the skilled modern workforce, overcome skill gaps, and help those in need, without worsening the budget. Importantly, there are easy mathematical ways of structuring the contract so they only pass on in the future what they otherwise would not have had. In other words, the FORTE model pays for itself in a guaranteed way. Investors get low-risk, short-term returns. They can do well while doing good. There is perfect alignment of social impact and financial returns.

They own, install and maintain rapid electric vehicle charging units all over the country, giving landowners the opportunity to earn a rental income by housing them, and giving EV drivers access to the fastest charging available. They are driven by their passion for protecting the environment. At their core is a mission to improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions. Air quality has reached critical levels in cities across the UK and cars, buses and lorries have been proven as contributing significantly to the problem. Increasing the use of electric vehicles, which emit zero emissions, is an important part of the solution. According to Government statistics, one of the biggest barriers that deters people from buying EVs is range anxiety – the fear of running out of charge. InstaVolt will ensure a rapid charging point is easily accessible to everyone in the country. They believe that charging an electric vehicle should be quick and easy.

But amidst this bustling marketplace, Vetty emerges as a beacon—a force of innovation that promises not just incremental improvements but a seismic shift in how hiring gets done. A Vision for the Future, Rooted in Today's Challenges Vetty is more than a platform; it’s a philosophy, a vision for what hiring can and should be in an interconnected, digital-first era. Born from an understanding of the intricacies and inefficiencies of traditional hiring processes, Vetty serves as the answer to the long-standing challenges faced by both employers and job-seekers. Lengthy, convoluted screening and verification? Those are relics of the past. In Vetty's world, the journey from extending an offer to onboarding an enthusiastic team member is streamlined, swift, and, most importantly, seamless. This isn't just about shaving off a few hours or days from the hiring cycle. Vetty's ambition is grander: to transform the very experience of hiring. From the candidate's first interaction to their first day on the job, every touchpoint is infused with Vetty’s commitment to efficiency, precision, and user-centricity. Mobile-First, But Human-Centric In an age where our smartphones are almost extensions of ourselves, Vetty's mobile-first approach isn't just a feature—it's a statement. A testament to the platform’s commitment to meet users where they are, offering them an experience that's intuitive and adaptive. But while the platform is undeniably tech-forward, its true prowess lies in its human-centric design. After all, behind every click, swipe, or tap is an individual with aspirations, seeking the right opportunity to thrive. Challenging the Status Quo At its heart, Vetty is a disruptor. Not for the sake of disruption, but to challenge and improve upon established norms that no longer serve our evolving workforce. The platform doesn't merely aim to fit into the existing ecosystem; it aspires to elevate it. By reimagining age-old screening processes, Vetty introduces a breath of fresh air into a domain that, for too long, has been mired in complexity and delays. Trust, Transparency, and Tenacity In today's interconnected world, trust isn't just a virtue; it's a prerequisite. Vetty understands this intrinsically. That's why, beyond its suite of features, the platform stands as a paragon of reliability. Employers and candidates alike can trust Vetty to facilitate a hiring process that's not just faster but also characterized by unwavering accuracy and transparency. Furthermore, Vetty’s tenacity is evident in its continuous pursuit of perfection.
