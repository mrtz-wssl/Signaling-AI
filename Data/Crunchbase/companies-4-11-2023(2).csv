Bank of Aria,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/internationalwalls,2020-01-01,year,"Banking, Consulting, Finance, Financial Services","New York, New York, United States",Bank of Aria is a commercial and investment bank that offers a range of financial services. founded by Radhesh Aria,"3,506",,Active,,,,,For Profit,,https://www.twitter.com/bankofaria,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bankofaria,"The Bank of Aria is a commercial and investment Bank formerly known as The International Reserve Corporation and Charlotte Heather Corporation, it also holds ownership of various other Global Financial Institutions and banks, although officially re-founded in 2020 by Radhesh Aria, a young entrepreneur and finance professional. The firm has its headquarters in the United States and manages a roughly estimated $0.12 Trillion ($120 Billion USD estimated) in assets under its management (AUM) as of 2023, and holds assets and other equivalents worth another approximately estimated $0.09 Trillion USD ($90 Billion USD). HISTORY Establishment  Bank of Aria, originally established in early 2022, resulted from the merger of the banking division of the House of Aria with two other investment banks, the International Reserve Corporation and the Charlotte Heather Corporation. This merger and subsequent formation of the bank were orchestrated under the leadership of Radhesh Aria, is the founder and president of the Bank of Aria since 2022. Subsequent to its establishment, the bank embarked on raising capital and making its presence felt in the private financial markets, all while safeguarding its private interests as a private investment and commercial bank. During its formative phase, the Bank of Aria issued a substantial volume of commercial notes, which were entirely retired by the year 2023. Since then, the bank has continued to actively issue commercial notes. In the latter half of 2022, the Bank of Aria expanded its operations by establishing a hedge fund division, offering private funds and trusts, engaging in block trades, and more. Additionally, the Bank of Aria operates a private trading firm that primarily trades in securities selected by the Bank of Aria on both open and closed markets. In February 2023, the Bank of Aria (BfA) faced a pivotal moment in its financial history as the total outstanding commercial notes surpassed several million dollars, placing its credit rating in risk of a downgrade due to fierce competition in the financial industry in the preceding years. In response to this, BfA initiated a major upgrade to its commercial notes issuing system, now known as and under the 'Bank of Aria Treasury ' or 'BfA Treasury.' This upgrade was carried out by an internal division of the Bank of Aria dedicated to managing and issuing of financial instruments, including commercial paper. Concurrently, the bank underwent a restructuring of its commercial paper division. During the same year, the Bank of Aria demonstrated its resilience on the market by issuing more than twice the volume of commercial paper compared to the previous year. Notably, most of BfA's commercial notes have a maturity period of less than 9 months, enabling the bank to swiftly address its outstanding debts caused by commercial paper. This flexibility in managing its financial obligations allowed BfA to respond promptly to emerging financial demands. Furthermore, the Bank of Aria expanded its operations by establishing a commodities trading arm, which operates in Switzerland under the banner of 'Bank of Suisse & Aria,' as part of the Swiss investment division of the Bank of Aria. This strategic move marked the bank's foray into commodities trading and demonstrated its commitment to diversifying its financial services portfolio. In April 2023, the Bank of Aria executed a series of strategic moves that significantly impacted its investment portfolio and expanded its presence in the financial industry. Notably, the bank made substantial stock purchases and allocated a significant amount of capital to investments in subsidiaries of Aria Atlantic, including Aria+, Ariã, Aria's, and other affiliates of the Aria Atlantic & Co. This strategic shift in investments has since become an integral part of the Bank of Aria's diversified portfolio. One of the most significant developments during this period was the establishment of a highly competitive fund under the umbrella of Bank of Aria Management Inc. This fund, known as 'Aria of America' or 'AofA,' is primarily based in New York and operates discreetly within the financial markets of New York. AofA employs a wide array of cutting-edge techniques, including various forms of analysis, high-frequency trading methods, and other innovative fintech backed computer models, all designed to provide the fund with a strategic advantage in navigating the complexities of the financial market. This venture underscores the Bank of Aria's commitment to staying at the forefront of financial innovation and its dedication to delivering value to its clients through astute investment strategies.",,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US","Convertible Note, Debt, Seed",Investment Bank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Professional Services",1,Radhesh Aria,1001-5000,5,,2023-04-14,4100000000,USD,4100000000,Debt Financing,100000000,USD,100000000,Undisclosed,100000000,USD,100000000,28356930903,USD,28356930903,"Aria Atlantic & Co., Radhesh Aria",2,2,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is more than one American Dream. Owning your home is one of those dreams. It's been an aspiration for a long time, and we know that millions struggle to achieve it. But there are other American Dreams. Some of these dreams are about living differently than previous generations - for whom owning was everything. We may want to use our cash to start a business. We may want to experience new places. We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging. This is a new mindset. We are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms ""landlord""​ and ""tenant""​ don’t apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them. Our owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants. We manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character. Before, renters often felt like second-class citizens; with us, they are an immediate and integral part of the community. So, whether you own property and you're looking for someone to live in it and love it, or you're looking for a home where you can put down roots – for however long you're planning to be there – we are the answer. Renting is the new American lifestyle.

Day Zero Diagnostics is on a mission to transform the way infectious disease diagnostics are performed by generating the stream of real-time sequencing data required to change how we track, manage and combat infectious diseases. With an enormous unmet clinical and economic need, we are targeting bloodstream infections and sepsis for our first application. The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to “carpet bomb” patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality.
