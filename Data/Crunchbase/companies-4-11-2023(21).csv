Its storage is designed for business agility. ClearSky simplifies enterprise storage by providing an SLA-based managed service across the global network. The company's patent-pending Smart Tiered Caching continually categorizes data and places it in the right cache layer (hot, warm, cold) based on evolving usage requirements and customer policies. Customers simply scale as needed, using the ClearSky dashboard to add unlimited capacity with a few clicks.   All data can be moved across the ClearSky network to meet a variety of use cases including data center migration, load balancing, expansion into new regions, or disaster recovery. ClearSky has partnered with major public clouds to place hot and warm cache copies at the cloud edge. The result: customers get low-latency access to cloud instances, providing a new cost-effective option to run their most demanding workloads. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of storing data using the ClearSky service is about 1/3 the cost of managing it in a company’s data center on physical storage arrays. By leveraging the architecture and building redundancy into all cache layers and network paths, ClearSky is able to provide an enterprise-class service with guaranteed high availability. Industry-leading security technologies and best practices ensure that customer data is always protected and isolated from the moment it enters the ClearSky network.

The Artory team’s deep experience in the art industry, combined with our network of partners and technology, allows Artory to accelerate the liquidity and investment opportunities for the most trusted physical artworks. With our unique Due Diligence Tool, Artory secures trusted information from expert partners to tokenize physical artworks and real-world assets. This process prepares these objects to be incorporated in traditional financial instruments, next-gen digital-first financial products, and other Web3 opportunities. Artory’s database, which contains over 44 million transaction records from auction houses across the globe, is a core dataset for the annual UBS + Art Basel Global Art Market Report, published by renowned economist Dr. Clare McAndrew. The database is essential to asset valuation when artworks or collectibles participate in digital primary or secondary markets, or other financial products. Artory was founded in 2016 by Nanne Dekking to accumulate and secure trusted data about artworks and collectibles. In 2018, The Artory Registry was the first platform to immutably record artwork information on the blockchain when Artory partnered with Christie’s to exclusively register each piece of art sold from the $323M Barney A. Ebsworth Collection. Through the partnership, Christie’s became the first auction house to record artwork transactions on the blockchain. Artory was launched for public use in late 2019 in partnership with Winston Art Group–the world’s leading independent appraisal firm. The collaboration with Winston Art Group allows individual collectors to register validated information about their personal artworks on the blockchain, giving collectors unprecedented access to the benefits of blockchain security. Since then, Artory has verified, secured on blockchain, and tokenized over $1.5B worth art and collectibles. Starting in 2021, Artory began leveraging the trusted artwork information to tokenize physical artworks to prepare them for safe and efficient trade in the digital financial markets. Artory also owns, maintains, and develops one of the largest databases of art market data. These data are used for sophisticated data insights and data-driven valuations and solutions.

This gives the consumer an incentive to recycle the package. Our world-unique position-based scanning technology enables consumers to receive a deposit value in their mobile phone when recycling their packaging at pinpointed places. Our solution can be connected to all sorts of packaging – everything from plastic bags to take-away mugs to products. There is no longer any need to invest in expensive reverse vending machines – instead, consumers are able to recycle at already existing recycling stations or at othe pinpointed locations selected by connected consumer brands. centivizing recycling with financial means is a proven way to increase recycling rates. Bower® is a mobile app that enables consumer brands to put a deposit value on their packaging – either in the form of money or points. By doing so, they take a greater responsibility for their packaging and, at the same time, get a direct relationship to their end-consumers through the app. To create a deposit system is simpler than it sounds.
