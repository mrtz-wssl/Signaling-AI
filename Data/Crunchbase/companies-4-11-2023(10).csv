An even faster transition, to hit net-zero globally by 2050, would require six times more mineral inputs in 2040. Energy transition therefore implies intensively mining critical metals like Cobalt, Nickel or even Lithium. It comes with significant externalities. It cannot be ignored anymore. From the children-labour-intensive copper belt to the major pollution from HPAL (High pressure acid leaching) lateritic nickel ore processing, critical metals are mined in a non sustainable and non responsible way from all around the world. The quest for commodities control is also triggering major conflicts and predatory behaviours. Strong imbalances between countries are emerging. Some (USA, EU etc.) are massively dependent on others for the supply of critical metals while having committed to aggressive objectives of metal-intensive carbon neutrality mix. This is casting doubt on the ability of conventional mining to match demand and while M&A on battery metals is fierce, capital deployment on exploration is lacking. Despite major downstream processing investments, mining sites opening, technology advancements and recycling, the market is unlikely to be able to absorb the demand surge.  We have entered into a commodities super-cycle that could last a decade and current options face technological, environmental and societal challenges. Some companies are exploring the depth of the oceans for the recovery of critical metals with major environmental risks and tight possibilities of mitigation. Others are trying to reach asteroids and mine them. It still remains a long shot with major technological barriers.  At Genomines, we have decided to leverage nature to extract metals in soils below traditional cut-off grades. We genetically enhance the natural ability of hyperaccumulator plants to absorb metals from soils and recover the metals from the biomass not only to sustainably mine metals but also to depollute soils and increase the pool of available agricultural sites.  Everyday, we fight to make green energy sustainable and in silence, we mine. www.genomines.com",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",2,"Dali Rashid, Fabien Koutchekian",11-50,3,Seed,2023-10-18,,,,Convertible Note,5200000,USD,5200000,Seed,5200000,USD,5200000,7380000,USD,7380000,"Elemental Excelerator, Bpifrance, Lowercarbon Capital, David Helgason, Nicolas Douay",2,6,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, files are encrypted, fragmented, redundantly stored, and distributed across geo-distributed networks called Swarms; this reduces the data risk around downtime, ransomware, and hacker attacks.

They expect their packages to arrive the next, or even the same day. It all relies on drivers, and means that owning a car opens up a world of earning potential. But not everyone has access to the right kind of car. That’s where Splend comes in. To date, we’ve helped people from all walks of life become their own bosses, with not just a car, but the tools to earn even more money, and become better drivers. Splend was launched in Sydney in 2015 after our founder, Chris King, realised that too many drivers were lacking both the cars and knowledge they needed to really thrive. It was a problem, but it could be fixed. Now, four years later, Splend is able to offer freedom to all kinds of people through car rental, and rent-to-own options. But we don’t stop there. We provide unprecedented levels of support and training, to help our members make the most of their time on the road. And, by providing members with data and analytics, we give them the opportunity to become more profitable and safer drivers. All that, plus the chance to connect with other drivers and be part of a growing community, making driving a more sustainable way of earning an income. Splend has enabled students, retirees, former refugees and single parents to find work they enjoy, and that fits their lifestyle. Equally, we’ve provided exciting opportunities for first-time buyers to own a brand new car. We couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re only just getting started.

The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications. But important developer workflows have been overlooked or neglected along the way. Many developers find that they’re now less productive than they were before the cloud native era. Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development. With Garden, developers get fast feedback exactly when they need it, and DevOps teams are no longer bogged down with provisioning and managing ad hoc environments.

Augmenta’s “Field Analyzer”, is a plug and play device that can be attached to any tractor and can determine the amount of fertilizers, fungicides and pesticides that every inch of the farm needs to reach to its full potential, all in real-time. Furthermore, Field Analyzer is capable of controlling agricultural machinery (e.g. fertilizer spreaders) also in real-time, applying the optimal amount of chemicals into every inch of the farm completely automatically and without the farmer lifting a finger. Finally, the farmer can use Augmenta’s field-viewer, the company’s easy to use web platform, to observe the progression of his field through visual data analytics which help him keep track of the results of Augmenta’s real time operation but also assist him on making data-driven, customized decisions for the future, in a farm level scale and not in a generic geographical (county or even state/country) level scale which is the norm today.

The majority of this market is going to be created through forward investments. One of the big things holding back the forward market today is carbon projects underperforming and the illiquid nature of the carbon investment market. Investing in a project gives you a forward contract for future credits. These forward contracts often underdeliver, and you can't do anything with this illiquid future promise for credits in 5+ years.  Solid World DAO accelerates carbon project development through fair, transparent and liquid markets. We de-risk carbon investments and make them liquid. The added safety of investing in carbon space will result in accelerated capital deployment and expansion cycles for carbon projects.
