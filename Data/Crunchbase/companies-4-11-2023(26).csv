We help our customers simplify the process of establishing a robust, end-to-end security architecture within the IoT and deliver efficiencies at scale through security automation. IoT brings new security challenges introduced by the scale and pace of adoption, as well as the physical consequences of compromised security. These challenges cannot be effectively addressed by traditional Information Technology (IT) security solutions. The Device Authority IoT security platform is purpose-built to address these challenges through automated device provisioning, credential management, secure updates and policy-driven data encryption. The IoT promises countless efficiencies, increased competitiveness, improved customer service and even brand new market opportunities. However, deploying strong security is hard and always has been. Deploying strong IoT security is even harder.  According to Gartner, by 2020, around 25% of all identified security breaches will involve IoT. To address this, Device Authority introduces a new paradigm of IoT Security Automation that accelerates and simplifies the deployment of strong IoT security. Advanced, policy driven security automation is critical for industrial, healthcare, transportation and other large scale security sensitive IoT environments. Our patented dynamic key technology provides the essential device-based trust anchor for IoT devices, enabling policy-driven provisioning, access control and data protection for mission-critical IoT applications and services.

We focused on developing a wireless vital signs tracking system, enabling remote monitoring and diagnosis. The system used wearable devices and advanced sensors to collect data such as heart rate, ECG, temperature, and oxygen saturation, which could be securely transmitted to healthcare professionals for analysis. Recognizing an opportunity in the pet healthcare market, Dindog Tech created a brand in 2016 called Dinbeat, dedicated to developing and marketing the animal version of their technology. We strategically prioritized the animal market because it allowed us to test and enhance our technology in a rapidly evolving environment with real patients.This approach not only improved our system but also generated revenue for further development in the human-use sector. We gained rapid traction in the pet industry as veterinarians and pet owners recognized the benefits of remote health monitoring for animals. The system allowed veterinarians to monitor their patients' health, facilitating early detection of potential issues and prompt veterinary interventions. To strengthen their focus and brand recognition, Dindog Tech decided to further separate the two business lines. In 2020, we launched Plug&Health, a separated brand solely dedicated to human telemedicine. Plug&Health emphasized the seamless integration of technology and health care services, aiming to provide efficient and accessible medical care to individuals worldwide.Meanwhile, Dinbeat continued to thrive as a trusted brand for animal health monitoring, expanding its product range to cater to different animal species.

LITT is an Australian born and bred community focused super app, that connects like- minded people, businesses and other key stakeholders in local communities. Once onboard, stakeholders can learn and earn from one another as well as share and support each other. We launched LITT because we believe in the power of positivity to grow every community. We believe all communities have good people who want to support one another and help their communities to thrive. However, we could not find a safe, positive, engaging and entertaining digital platform that delivered on this simple goal. And thus began our quest for launching LITT. LITT combines elements of social media, e-commerce and digital payments all rolled up into one seamless, safe and trusted experience.   How Does LITT work?  Our unique business model enables LITT members to earn digital cash as they watch ads put out by local businesses on their newsfeed (unlike other platforms, we share a part of our ad-revenue with members). This digital cash earned by members sits in their built-in LITT digital wallet – LITT Pay. LITT Cash can be spent at one of the local business on the LITT platform. We refer to this unique circular flow of money within the LITT platform (from businesses to members and then back to businesses), as the LITT circular economy. Why LITT matters? LITT is a membership driven platform that rewards users for their time and engagement.  We think the world needs safer, more local focused community platforms to help people connect in positive ways. By bringing together and celebrating key community stakeholders on our Australian domiciled platform, we not only harness the power of positivity in local communities. We also ensure that each Australian business’ ad expenditure is reported and taxed on- shore. This incredibly important detail ensures that the Australian Federal Government stewards its annual tax, which can then be re-invested into further developing our communities.",https://www.facebook.com/thelittapp/,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Australasia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Advertising, Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Payments, Software",2,"Brent Thompson, Peter Salom",11-50,1,Seed,2019-01-01,3000000,AUD,2114453,Seed,3000000,AUD,2114453,Seed,3000000,AUD,2114454,3000000,AUD,2114454,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,

In our spare time, we also build things with machine learning that are less practical but still wildly impactful, including but not limited to a life-like AI facsimile of Joe Rogan’s voice. We take our role as pioneers of applied artificial intelligence and technology seriously, and in all of our projects, examine how we can advance technology in a way that is responsible to the people, organizations and places it is built for.",,Great Lakes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software",4,"Eric Kin Ho Lee, Ragavan Thurairatnam, Stephen Piron, Vincent F Wong",11-50,2,M&A,2017-09-13,9000000,USD,9000000,Series A,9000000,USD,9000000,Series A,9000000,USD,9000000,9000000,USD,9000000,"NEXT Canada, Fidelity, Sweat Equity Ventures",1,3,,Was Acquired,2020-02-07,day,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,1,,,7,0,1,,Scientific and technological services,,,

In addition to that, our electronic prescription system will allow you to have your prescribed medications, delivered to your doorstep with clear instructions for administering the correct dosage. Moreover, if the doctors feel that your condition renders you unfit to work or attend the university or school, they will issue your medical certificate and email it after the visit. Shall there be any further investigations required like blood tests etc., our electronic investigation requesting system will organize a booking for the requested test and the laboratory staff will soon get in touch to organize a suitable time, for attending to the patient’s premises and collecting the specimens? Being committed to providing the continuity of medical care, our doctors will check the results and discuss with you the finding during a follow-up phone call, video conference, or a second visit if required. AT-HOME-DOC is not an emergency service; hence, our triage nurses will only take the bookings for the patients that suffer from acute but not emergent medical conditions complying with the company’s policy and divert any emergency to the emergency services, if appropriate. However, our doctor might refer the patient to a hospital, if the doctor suspects any potential risk or confirms any acute emergency that would be deemed unsuitable for home care. Our Doctor will then work with the control tower on organizing the patients’ transfer to the nearest hospital if required.

The growing epidemic of NCDs threatens the ambition of countries around the world to achieve sustainable, universal access to health and universal health coverage for their populations. Moreover, NCDs leave populations more susceptible to communicable diseases such as coronaviruses, influenza and tuberculosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, 78% of people admitted to ICU in the US and 94% of those who died had underlying health conditions (CDC). NCDs remain underesearched and underserved in women. Until the mid-1990s, clinical research and clinical trials largely excluded women. Only since 1994, when the United States’ National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandated that women and minorities were to be included as subjects in clinical research, has the research community entertained the fact that sex and/or gender differences might affect clinical outcomes. Today, women using drugs that were approved by the early 90s, are 50–75% more likely than men to suffer adverse reactions to those therapies. Ironically, a significant proportion of the drugs in this category are those designed to treat or manage NCDs. Examples include statins and potassium channel-blockers used to manage cardiovascular disease or hypoglycaemic drugs such as Rezulin used to control diabetes. Nabta’s first hybrid care pathway supports women in preventing, identifying and managing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder responsible for 70% of female fertility issues. Women who use Nabta’s platform will be able to achieve a formal diagnosis of PCOS within 90 days.
