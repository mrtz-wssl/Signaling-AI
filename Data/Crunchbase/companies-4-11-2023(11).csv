In 1988, Wonderware transformed how machines run, with the introduction and mass commercialization of Human-Machine Interface software. Wonderware enabled the first software-based industrial revolution and is still in evidence today by Wonderware’s continued leadership position. In 1998, Lighthammer transformed manufacturing yet again with the introduction of the first Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence platform. Lighthammer revolutionized the factory floor by bringing both real time intelligence and live synchronization with the ERP software layer. This enabled the second software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of this software (currently under the SAP MII brand). In 2008, ThingWorx catalyzed the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with the introduction of the first application platform for IIoT. ThingWorx transformed both manufacturing and service, becoming synonymous with Industrie 4.0/Brilliant factory, and Connected Service. This enabled the 3rd software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of IIoT software and, the market leadership of PTC’s ThingWorx brand. In 2018, the founders of Augmentir recognized that the technology and market forces were aligned yet again, for a fourth industrial software revolution. A revolution focused on increasing the productivity & quality of processes involving front-line workers. With a global footprint of 350 million workers in manufacturing and service, they are being asked to perform increasingly complex jobs using technology that has remained relatively unchanged for 20 years.

Regular trading makes it difficult to keep track of the individual trades. This is mainly because every single transaction, including the exchange within crypto currencies, must be valued as a taxable event. If the tax office requests a declaration or proof, it will be difficult to provide this afterwards.   This is where Blockpit's software solution can help. The monitoring platform automatically records all sources of income and creates a clear log. Every single transaction is imported and guarantees a daily documentation of all trades.

Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyze all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimizing dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time.

It is the only case of life protection insurance on demand that is sustainable not only because it is completely paperless but also because it's inclusive thanks to products developed directly with RGA, a world leader in life reinsurance. It's also instant thanks open API platform that allows full digital customer onboarding through a need-based product proposition. Last but not least it is self service: in 3 minutes customers in a single process purchase and download the Policy online with the support of digital tools such as the Protection Calculator and the human touch of the excellent omni-digital customer service. viteSicure, brand of the insurance broker Bridge insurance Services is authorized to distribute insurance products in the European Economical Space and guaranteed by a Team with over 25 years of expertise in insurance, marketing and tech. Why viteSicure In Italy, 48% of families do not save, 61% suffer from anxiety about the economic future of the family and only 6% have life protection insurance. This is called Protection GAP (difference between resources needed and available at the death of the head of the family) and is a worldwide problem while companies are still focused on offering savings products, not aligned with the new buying habits of customers, with complicated and old processes, ignoring the millions of financially vulnerable customers. Customers are online, reacting to advertising and using technology and so we believed that digital transformation was the solution to engage customers, educate them about the insurance solution, reduce the distance to insurance and meet the demands and needs immediately. Technology is our enabler for reaching the financially vulnerable. Our open API platform enables fully digital processes not only with insurance companies as is the case with most digital brokers but across the entire value chain thus enabling full transformation and integration of processes.

ESR is one of the largest third-party landlords for some of the world’s top e-commerce companies, bricks-and-mortar retailers, 3PLs and cold-chain logistics providers. The rapid growth in e-commerce, greater supply chain efficiencies, and consolidation by third-party logistics providers are a major driver of their growing development activity. ESR, headquartered in Hong Kong, was formed through the merger of e-Shang and Redwood in January 2016. After the combination of these two platforms, the group has progressed at an accelerated rate with further enhanced investor composition and expansion in multiple markets. e-Shang was co-founded by Warburg Pincus and two entrepreneurs, Sun Dongping and Jeffrey Shen in 2011, and pre-merger had grown to be one of the largest developers and operators of modern logistics facilities in China. In 2014, e-Shang entered into the Korean market through its investment in the Kendall Square platform and later secured substantial capital commitments from the top tier global investors to support its outsized growth in the market. The Redwood Group was founded by Stuart Gibson and Charles de Portes in 2006 and was backed by Sam Zell’s Equity International from 2013. Pre-merger it was a leading developer, investor in Japan and China with Singapore capital and funds management and a primary focus on the identification and execution of logistics, warehousing, and transportation real estate solutions for some of the largest end users.

Matrix.org’s aim is to fix the problem of fragmented IP-communications between devices, people and services, and make them as seamless and interoperable as possible. Matrix addresses use cases like VoIP, IoT and instant messaging but its real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web - allowing anyone and anything to easily communicate securely, maintaining full conversation history with no single points of control or failure. Any developer can use Matrix to easily create and host their own feature-rich real-time communication apps or add such features to an existing service whilst building on the Matrix community of users. Existing communication services can also easily join in and integrate with the Matrix ecosystem. The Matrix standard specifies simple RESTful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room’ on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room’. This data is signed using a blockchain-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server’s private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows eventual consistency semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by resynchronizing missing history from other participating servers. End-to-end encryption ensures data at rest is only readable by the room participants. The result is that data transmitted over Matrix is never stored in any single place, and is instead securely shared on a purely need-to-know basis between relevant parties, with control of access residing solely with the author.

In partnership with leading international corporations, CORE POWER aims to deliver durable zero-emission energy for floating industrial production and deep-sea shipping. Advanced atomic technologies are set to create the first sustainable zero-emission energy system for ocean transportation and represents an economic opportunity worth $27 billion by 2040. It can form the start of a ‘second atomic era’, where climate change is the main driver of powerful, inexpensive, and safe new energy solutions.  Over the next few decades as many as 60,000 ships must transition from combustion of fossil fuels to zero-emission propulsion. The UN’s maritime agency IMO has mandated with unanimous approval from 174 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total, before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90%, by 2050. The m-MSR can achieve that goal alone, by producing green sustainable fuels for the smaller ships and powering the largest ships. Zero emissions come as standard. Advanced atomic technologies are like atomic battery packs. Small, with few moving parts, it can be a third cheaper to run than a large fossil fuelled engine. It massively reduces waste, and is fuelled-for-life, avoiding proliferation of spent fuel. Advanced atomic technologies can be inherently walk-away safe. Atomic reactors produce heat. Therefore, the coolant is the key to safety. This is the very definition of passive walk-away safety which will create a positive public opinion. Advanced atomic technologies have an economic potential which is greater than that of oil and gas.

Before founding ZeroAvia, eMotorWerks was acquired by international energy conglomerate Enel. A licensed pilot, Miftakhov saw an opportunity to pursue his dream of flying airplanes while also electrifying them and completely transforming commercial transportation. ZeroAvia developed a vision to serve as a responsible steward of the environment by bringing hydrogen-powered aircraft to the market. The hydrogen-electric powertrain technology vastly reduces carbon emissions and reduces noise, all while lowering fuel and maintenance costs for airlines. For ZeroAvia's promising HyFlyer I project, the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) delivered the fueling systems necessary for test flights as well as infrastructure designed for airports. The HyFlyer II project will carry more passengers and fly up to 500 miles, with the ambitious goal of seating up to 100 passengers and traveling more than 1,000 miles by 2030. As consumer preferences shift toward other methods of travel due to concerns about sustainability, and with the airline industry battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, ZeroAvia is capitalizing on the need for carbon-free transportation options. British Airways has formed a partnership with ZeroAvia to achieve its net-zero goal by 2050. Upon receiving $21.4 million in series A funding in conjunction with $16.3 million in grant funds from the UK government from the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), ZeroAvia has raised $49.7 million from inception to bring hydrogen fuel cells to the market by 2023.",https://www.facebook.com/zeroavia,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Sustainability, Transportation",1,Val Miftakhov,51-100,14,,2023-09-18,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,123700000,USD,123700000,140700000,USD,140700000,"Innovate UK, Elemental Excelerator, Alumni Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG)",12,30,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-63.97%,80,,,16,18,15,Basic Electric Elements,Vehicles,225582,USD,225582

Corsha’s patented platform builds dynamic identities for trusted machines and securely authenticates API requests through one-time-use MFA credentials for greater security, visibility, and control. API secrets are often shared, rarely rotated and painful to manage. Organizations lack visibility into the machines that are leveraging these secrets, and as automation shifts risk from human to machine, the identities of these machines and the secrets they use is more important than ever. Corsha ensures that only trusted machines are accessing an enterprise’s APIs. Corsha has developed the first and only dynamic, fully automated multi-factor authentication (MFA) for APIs.  We protect APIs using the same MFA principles that have successfully protected systems from human username/password cyberattacks. By enabling MFA for every API call, our platform cryptographically defines the network so that only authorized machines can connect to applications and data, resulting in a dynamic identity for every deployed machine.   Through our central management console, security professionals have full visibility into and complete control of all API activity across cloud and enterprise networks.
