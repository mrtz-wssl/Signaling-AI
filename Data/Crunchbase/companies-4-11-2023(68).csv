Every day thousands of containers are shipped all across the globe. The time required is disproportionate to the actual work that is required to process these shipments. Numerous phone calls, emails and even faxes are required in order to process one shipment. This requires a lot of time and labor and costs a lot of money. Trying to track shipments is nearly impossible. The frustration level for both the shipper and the vendors is always at an all time high. Transship's platform is B2B and IoT. The User (shipper) simply has to upload required information such as what they are shipping, when, where, consignee as well as required documentation. On the back end, Transship will communicate with all the vendors via API and blockchain technology. This will not only speed up the processing of every shipment, but will also make it more efficient and require less labor. End result is a cost savings for the vendors and the shippers.  Each shipment processed through Transship will have a tracking device. This will allow every User to know exactly where their shipment is, real time updates and real time temperature readings. Transship also has an agreement with TradeLens to use their API and blockchain technology on our site.  Transship will replace all outdated freight forwarders with modern day technology that is so sorely lacking in the logistics industry. Transship will serve the global marketplace with the ability to process shipments from anywhere around the world.

Contractors, third party haulers and DOT members work together using BroadLoop for dispatching, E-Ticketing, cycle time analysis, field process efficiency and more. In 2021, the Federal Highway Administrator included E-Tickets in their Every Day Counts - 6 initiative to help drive efficiency throughout the industry. E-Ticketing is more than just digitization or ""going paperless"". BroadLoop participated in the steering committee with AASHTO to help define the consistent requirements around data transfer, formatting and process for transmitting digital load ticket details. Data can now be accessed in realtime with higher accuracy which eliminates a great deal of manual intervention, delays and expense.  Asphalt Contractors rely on third party dump trucks to haul the material they produce at the plant to the jobsite where the crew is waiting for it. Because they do not own these assets, they operate at a disadvantage due to the lack of visibility over this virtual fleet. When there are no trucks to provide material to the paving crew, they sit idle which costs the contractor $1,000/hr and leads to a $1B loss across the industry every year in the US.

Our survey of health professionals revealed that less than half felt confident interpreting ECGs, 60% found it difficult to diagnose based on ECG recordings and only 2% trusted the suggestions from their current device. HATO utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in real-time and provide accurate and timely diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases.

Just like the cryptocurrencies themselves, Resardis lives on the blockchain. This essentially means that all the trading happens on the blockchain, secured by the state-of-art cryptography and immune to manipulation. Users are the sole owners of their funds, and the exchange does not have any control over the assets. There is nothing stored on the exchange servers, and therefore nothing to steal by the hackers or the exchange admins. You might wonder how we overcome the shortcomings of a decentralized exchange, in that case directly skip over to the side-chain section.  As a decentralized platform, Resardis has a zero-knowledge policy about the customers. Users do not need to sign up with sensitive and personal information. In this context, Resardis is just an intermediary platform which helps traders to find each other and facilitates trading. Just create an address, stay anonymous and start trading. No way to conclude who did what. Users have full control over the funds, meaning they are the only owners of the private keys. Since the keys to crypto wallets are not stored on the exchange servers, even if the exchange gets hacked, there is nothing to steal. Stop trading on centralized exchanges where there is always a possibility of mass cryptocurrency loss. Resardis Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is built on top of the side-chain technology. As a second layer solution, side-chain is optimized for scalable decentralized applications, while keeping the base-layer security of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike the other DEXs, trading is blazing-fast (1 second), the platform can handle super-high trading traffic, the trading orders live on the blockchain for free, and lastly it is possible to trade non-Ethereum and non-ERC20 based crypto-currencies such as TRON, Bitcoin and EOS. No more long trading durations and on-blockchain order fees, all while including cross-blockchain trading.",https://facebook.com/resardis,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Middle East, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Payments, Software",2,"İlhan Cem Duru, Yekcan Güler",1-10,2,,2020-07-28,150000,TRY,21602,Grant,,,,,,,,185000,TRY,27680,"European Fund for Southeast Europe, Turk Telekom PILOT",2,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,

This impacts the security of the application and trust of the consumer. Kandola solves this problem, by providing a true, decentralised database that guarantees availability, scalability and security.  In Web2, there is an increasing trend of enterprises moving away from AWS and similar cloud hosted databases and services due to increasing cost. The promise of low overheads and convenience by centralised cloud service providers has failed due to steep costs.

Portal Our site is the world's largest private producer of articles, photostories, and videos, about tourism into Japan. This was made possible by our unique crowdsourcing User Generated Content engine, which lets more than 30,000 writers, photographers, editors, and others earn and redeem points for travel rewards. Currently Japan Travel has over 30,000 contributors, about 3,000 of whom live in Japan, who help us create 20-50 new articles a day in 13 different languages. Our main businesses from this portal are advertising revenue, activities sales, and content/marketing projects for local governments and large corporations around the country. Travel Business We are one of the few foreign-owned Type-2 travel agencies in Japan, and we build our services and products with non-Japanese people in mind. This means copious high-grade information, transparent pricing, and responsive customer service. Our targets are adventure and luxury travel, with the initial adventures being cycling and hiking, while the luxury travel revolves around special custom-built experiences and gourmet. We are the preferred partner of the Japanese secretariat of the YPO and handle a number of inbound YPO groups each year. In short, our goal is to kill off ""old people tourism"" based on buses and herd instinct, and instead open up rural Japan and the magical experiences it has to offer. Japan Travel has parlayed its content experience into a national travel business community, collaborating with self-employed partners all around Japan to offer adventurous guests locally curated but professional travel in areas that few tourists travel to. In this way, we are able to compete with the leading OTAs by offering local knowledge and language support they don't have. Travel Systems The shared economy has been slow iin reaching Japan, and Japan Travel is one of the leaders in building APIs and doing integration of Japanese large corporate data to consumer-based applications. Our ""crowd in the cloud"" assists us, by providing translation and support, where such customer handholding is required.

The reality is that data is increasingly complex (structured, unstructured, internal and external, dynamic and different volumes and varieties) so developing scenarios becomes an arduous and frustrating job as it has traditionally been done for decades (technology, budget, time, organizational structure, human resource competencies, and analytical processes that require them to be recurrent). Therefore, decision making, execution, monitoring, adjustments and evolution become fragile, slow, expensive and highly unproductive processes and, mainly, incomplete (due to the difficulty of organizing the most varied sources of data).

This allows the Respicorder to be deployed directly to the patient, for daily monitoring that can provide real-time feedback on care decisions. While no single test provides a gold standard, using a collection of different devices is uneconomical and impractical. Our solution combines together the key breathing-based tests of lung function and inflammation, to get the whole picture of the lungs. Each additional test module costs a fraction of an additional device and is far more compact. The different tests we do (spirometry, FeNO, and impulse oscillometry) have very different operating principles and flow requirements. Our re-configurable device can address this technical challenge. To meet the cost and usability requirements of a remote monitoring device, we have several patent-pending innovations.

Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty point’s clearinghouse that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy efficient marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. Rewards.com was spun off from DBG Loyalty in Dallas, a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. The startup includes the executive leadership and mature platform from the parent company. The platform is solid and proven, with 10k registered users, over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and many more. Revenue is generated each time someone makes a purchase on a merchant site. The merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com. They also provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site, is a market first. URL: www.Rewards.com  Industry: Loyalty Points Clearinghouse  What: Consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient marketplace  Beta Launch: June 2017  Current Situation: Platform is built and already has 10k active users; over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, CBS, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and more.  PROBLEM IN THE MARKET Customers have an average of 29 loyalty programs per. Redeeming is a nightmare.  Customers are tired of too many programs and not enough reward. SOLUTION Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty points clearing house that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient clearinghouse marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. The company was spun out of a 15-year old loyalty database marketing company (DBG Loyalty located in Dallas) who is a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. WHY NOW? Coalitions are highly successful in other countries and have been for many years.  The timing is right for the United States and Rewards.com is the right opportunity because it is credit card, bank, and retailer neutral, giving it an edge in forming partnerships with coalition members. MARKET SIZE $291 billion ecommerce industry in the US. (*IBIS World) The Rewards.com Marketplace literally allows a shopper to purchase anything. Electronics, Department Stores, Travel, Office Supplies, Gift Cards, and Home goods are among the most popular categories. Shoppers of all ages, races, and incomes have increasingly more expectations of lower prices combined with a higher value. Rewards Marketplace is the solution for both, giving the Rewards Marketplace an edge over singular businesses that depend on either a low-cost or high-value strategies. The target market includes shoppers who are making purchases online or through a mobile device or tablet, as well as at in-store. Our goal is to identify profitable customers and their purchase patterns, and reward desirable behavior accordingly. Truly giving insight and understanding to behavior loyalty. BUSINESS MODEL Breakage and float are two strategic parts of gift cards and point redemptions. The value of unredeemed points and unused gift cards has significant value. Rewards.com sells points as part of their service offering to marketplace members, and breakage has accrued value. Ultimately Rewards wins if a shopper redeems their point because essentially they just made another purchase that is subject to retailer commission. In addition, revenue is derived from: •	Merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com for customers and provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. •	Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. •	Revenue from “Featured Advertising” and product placement •	Revenue from Email promotions to the Rewards.com customer database TECHNOLOGY •	Scalable software architecture with the flexibility to dynamically target customers and feature partners. •	Easy for customers to use and gain valuable shopping experiences with the incentives for the masses. COMPETITION Ebates.com is a cash-back model. Although hugely successful they struggle with shopper engagement and retaining shoppers year-after-year. Churn is high and engagement is low. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site is a market first. •	Mature and proven technology platform is live •	Seasoned executives who innovated loyalty programs for American Airlines, American Express, IHG and more. •	Estimated customer base 30mm •	Signed strategic partnerships MARKETING PLAN With a $3m raise, $2m will be spent reaching two goals. •	The first goal is to reach 105k active subscribers to reach $7m in revenue. •	The second goal is to reach 180k active subscribers to reach critical mass.

Mitochondria generates ATP, the energy source for all cellular activities. Mitochondria are also involved in other essential cellular functions, including calcium sequestration, amino acid and lipid metabolism, keeping balanced redox potential and orchestrating programmed cell death. In neurons in particular, mitochondria are very dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission (division) and fusion. This process, called mitochondrial dynamics, is critical in maintaining healthy and functional mitochondria under both normal conditions and in response to stress and in ensuring having viable mitochondria along the axons and in the synaptic boutons. A defect in either fusion or fission limits mitochondrial motility, decreases energy production, increases oxidative stress and activates pro-apoptotic signaling thereby promoting cell dysfunction and death. Mitoconix’ lead drug is a first-in-class inhibitor of pathological mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction with demonstrated in vivo efficacy in animal models of Huntington’s (HD) and Parkinson’s diseases (PD) and beneficial activity in patient-derived cells of HD, sporadic and genetic PD, and sporadic and genetic Alzheimer’s disease (AD).",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Middle East",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Daria Mochly Rosen,1-10,1,Early Stage Venture,2017-06-27,20000000,USD,20000000,Series A,20000000,USD,20000000,Series A,20000000,USD,20000000,20000000,USD,20000000,"OrbiMed, Arix Bioscience, Dementia Discovery Fund, Remiges Ventures, RM Global Partners",1,5,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,

Jooxter was developed at Euratechnologies, the heart of innovation in the Hauts-de-France region. As Director of Workplace Technologies at GWS Global Workplace Solutions (Johnson Controls), Fabien noticed a general irrelevance with existing solutions on the market. They required heavy maintainance, were intrusive (often required wiring and on-prem servers), and were completely isolated reflecting an inability to interact with the connected environment of the building, the essential requirement of a Building Operating System (BOS). Moreover, today everyone talks about reducing building energy expenditure when it only represents 1% of business expenses! But what about office occupancy? Rental expenses are the biggest business expense after salaries. This is how the Jooxter solution was born and became a pioneer in Smart Occupancy. Today, Jooxter has become a reference in the Proptech domain and is growing exponentially. Fabien brought together an amazing team was built, combining experience and youth to make the most out of technology. As a responsible and innovative company with solid foundations, Jooxter's mission is to make the buildings of every organisation 100% responsible, and subsequently 100% occupied. Today, Jooxter is recognised as an expert in the field of Smart Building. Fabien Girerd is an active member of the Commission R2S for Spaces within the Smart Building Alliance (SBA).""",https://www.facebook.com/jooxter/,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Internet Services, Real Estate, Software",2,"Fabien Girerd, Thomas Thelliez",11-50,2,Seed,2016-12-14,1000000,EUR,1051358,Seed,1000000,EUR,1051358,Seed,1000000,EUR,1051359,1000000,EUR,1051359,"Newfund, VentureOut",,2,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,27,1,218,38,,,,,,,

Critical in helping pathologists diagnose more cases faster, they aim to develop into a true virtual AI pathology wizard that empowers pathology experts to remotely diagnose patients faster and more accurately. A multidimensional business model. To maximize accuracy and efficiency, Zaya is based on three different pillars: the medical clinic, the pathology lab and the AI tool they use to bring it all together.  AI tool already performing similarly to expert pathologists. Currently, Zaya AI has a really impressive database of digitized tissue images of several pathologies, with about 500,000 cases and millions of tissue images. But the real head-turner is that their AI model has reached a performance similar to real expert pathologists.  7/9 on the NASA tech readiness scale - This means that their prototypes are tested and demonstrated in an operational environment such as hospitals and pathology labs. The potential of Zaya AI extends far beyond conventional boundaries: it’s already conquering groundbreaking strides in drug discovery, predictive therapy, and a remarkable reduction in laboratory costs, alongside an impressive threefold increase in diagnostic speed while concurrently diminishing the margin of human error by a noteworthy 30%. Mitigating the global shortage of pathology workers. From a macroscopic perspective, the deficit is glaring. Ideally, there should be 10 specialists for every 100,000 people, while the EU average is 3 pathologists, with countries like Germany where there are only 2 pathologists per hundred thousand.  The consequence of talent shortage in healthcare is that it leads to late diagnoses, poorer medical care and poorer overall patient outcomes.

This technology empowers pharmaceutical researchers and clinicians with tools to develop and personalize treatments for patients with chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and heart failure. We have several medical device products in the pipeline and offer our research & development expertise in assay development and clinical biomarker measurement, with an emphasis on oxidative stress and nitric oxide signaling. With the advent of biomarker analysis for monitoring disease severity and progression (airway inflammation, lung function) there is a desire to shift towards remote patient monitoring via non-invasive biomarkers to improve treatment plans and lower overall costs on the healthcare system. Our initial programs are focused on asthma, COPD, and hypertension. Our breath analysis product, The BioSense AMD (Airway Monitoring Device), provides a ‘window into the lung’ by measuring oxidative stress biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Our test requires no complicated breathing maneuvers, allowing reliable at-home monitoring. These frequent, objective measurements of lung function offer significant patient benefits, provide physicians a tool to optimize treatment, and enable researchers to stratify patients in clinical trials to better understand chronic respiratory disease states. Our blood analysis product measures nitric oxide and nitrative stress metabolites in the blood using a simple finger-prick test.

Founded in 2015, it aims to contribute to the construction of a safer and more sustainable Food system. Wenda is the only all-in-one collaborative Platform to govern Food traceability data from the cold and hot chain. Wenda is a collaborative Platform that automatically collects, analyzes and shares supply chain data, automatically integrating with existing measurement tools, data loggers and management, logistics and quality software available on the market and already in use in the customer company. In this way it provides decision support and statistics on temperature and traceability to each player in each specific supply chain. Wenda’s multi-disciplinary team has a long experience in technology, in the management of corporate clients and in agile innovation methods (IoT solutions). It has developed key partnerships with Universities and leading European companies. Wenda mission is to contribute to the reduction of the Food waste by leveraging on the power of digitalization of the Food supply chain. At the same time, the company aims to contribute to the development of safety and traceability in the food system. Wenda developed an user-friendly, ease-to use and versatile Platform which automatically collects, controls, manages and shares food distribution supply chain data, integrating with measurement tools, data loggers and software (management, logistics and quality). The Platform responds to the food distribution companies needs for reduction of time and costs for the optimization of their processes and necessity of control of risk points. Wenda products can be widespread at a global level. The innovativeness of its technology, international vocation and its scalable business model make its solution the best one in allowing to effectively pursue its mission. Below is a list of the different features of the Platform. -Data management and integrity analytics: You can gain visibility into traceability and temperature data by controlling the main risk points in the supply chain. With the simple and easy-to-use all-in- one Platform, you can enhance your decision making and service level, cutting costs, optimizing time and increasing profits. -Document digitization and data storage: you can import the documents of each shipment, storage or goods entry, reducing storage time, quickly retrieving information and documents, receiving alerts and operational actions, sharing data with employees. All this from a single integrated and easy to use Platform. -Universal IoT Platform: The full potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be exploited to integrate all data loggers and measuring instruments already in use in the customer company or available on the market and to make them communicate with each other. In this way you can save time and ensure continuity with the technologies already in use, welcoming future developments. -Horizontal process management: You can increase your supply chain collaboration by working across the company and strengthening your connection with customers and suppliers. Thanks to multi-site management and multi-access control, you can choose with whom to share data in real time, allowing access to logistics, quality and management departments. This data can also be shared directly with suppliers and customers. -Blockchain, Big Data and Machine learning: the use of blockchain has three major benefits: transparency (everyone can visualize the information recorded on the blockchain), decentralization (blockchain operates on a network), security (data and transactions on the blockchain are encrypted). All the data gathered in the Platform form a huge quantity of data (Big Data): this improve the quality of decisions operators can make on the basis of that data, An additional help comes from the Machine Learning algorithm integrated in the Platform: the machine “learns” the best and most efficient way to manage processes and builds more and more refined models which can help operators in making decisions. A key goal of the Platform is to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility. This is why the Platform is organized into modules, allowing the customer to choose the ones needed for operations: taken individually, the modules manage temperature and heat and cold chain traceability in well-defined supply chain processes; when used in combination, the modules provide full end-to-end visibility of supply chain processes, supporting key players in making effective decisions, rationalizing costs, increasing profits and enhancing service levels. Below is a review of the different modules of the Platform: Shipping Phase - SHIPMENT Module Control, manage and share cold and heat chain data and traceability of products shipped in direct or split trucks, full containers (FCL) or groupage (LCL). Share information with customers and employees through the Shipment Module. -Control and management from web app -Verification of the condition of goods in transit -Logistic performance control -Savings from delivery optimization -Integrated data loggers: real-time datalogger / USB datalogger, Sea freight, Ground freight, Air freight, location, temperature, humidity and other sensors Storage phase - STORAGE Module Control, manage and share temperature data and traceability of old generation cold rooms, refrigerated display cabinets, manholes or refrigerators or already controlled with telemetry, and provide information to employees with the Storage Module. -Control and management from web app and mobile app -Digitizing the control of stored products -Verification of refrigeration systems -Save time on HACCP checks and reports -Integrated data loggers: wi-fi real-time data loggers / Bluetooth probes or data loggers / other instruments already in use in the company Reception stage - INBOUND Module Verify the product for which you will be responsible by checking, managing and sharing the temperature data and HACCP checklists detected during the goods entry.
