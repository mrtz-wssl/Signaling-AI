The proliferation of connected devices promises to revolutionize consumer, commercial and industrial applications with greater convenience, lower operational costs and data-driven performance improvements. Already consumers have fallen in love with smart home conveniences, while many businesses have begun to reap the benefits of connected device driven efficiency gains such as electronic shelf labels and occupancy sensors. Giga scale applications for these technologies are around the corner: the potential exists for billions of wireless sensors to be installed during the coming decade, with nearly half located inside buildings. However, the challenge of reliably and affordably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale. Connected electronics require continuous power, which until now has meant batteries that must be periodically replaced or recharged. Legacy photovoltaic technologies like amorphous silicon cells long used on solar calculators and childrens toys don’t yield sufficient power in the real-world, low light operational conditions for most IoT sensors. At the same time, the exorbitant price tag for high performance, low-light PV technologies like gallium arsenide cells has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics.

About Bioactives   Bioactives are small molecule compounds produced by plants, fungi, and microbes that grow in and adapt to environments that present a wide range of challenges to their survival. Bioactives also benefit the health of humans – they are the enlivening caffeine in tea, the powerful antioxidant lycopene in tomatoes, and they inform active ingredients in medicines like Taxol, Aspirin and Metformin, a first-line treatment for Type 2 diabetes, derived from the French lilac flower. Science has long known that bioactives are critical to human health, yet the vast majority remain unknown and uncharted. Brightseed’s A.I., Forager®, discovers bioactives in nature and maps them to human health outcomes at a rate and accuracy that was previously impossible.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Jim Flatt, Lee Chae, Sofia Elizondo",51-100,6,Early Stage Venture,2022-08-22,,,,Series B,,,,Series B,119000000,USD,119000000,119200000,USD,119200000,"Temasek Holdings, AgFunder, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, S2G Ventures, Horizons Ventures",3,14,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,12,6,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,Scientific and technological services,,,

This means putting candidates first — not companies. Today we're focused on building the better way to find a fulfilling job in tech. In the future, we'll help people find jobs at all of the best companies. Looking for a job is a frustrating experience. It's incredibly hard to find a good match. Job adverts lack useful information like salary and diversity data. Companies sometimes never respond. There’s a lack of friendly-support in those tough moments of rejection … the list goes on. When starting Otta, we saw that candidates are often treated as second-class citizens. So we set out to build a candidate-first job search: one that is laser-focused on providing the best experience for candidates. There’s a big market to go after in recruitment, with LinkedIn selling over $10bn/year of recruitment products. But it’s impossible to battle a giant like LinkedIn if you try and compete on all jobs from Day 1. So we chose tech companies as our first move. As we grow, we’ll expand into other industries to help more people find fulfillment. Since launching in Jan 2020, we’ve grown from 1,000 applications sent per month to multiple thousands sent every day, across the UK & US. Otta is becoming a must-have for companies, and this puts us in a strong position to demand a better experience for candidates.

Permanent magnets play a vital, hidden role in modern technologies.  Common devices that we use daily, such as computers, appliances, and automobiles are powered by permanent-magnet motors that convert electricity to motion.  In the production of electricity, permanent magnets are found at the heart of generators. Despite their ubiquity, however, magnets themselves have not kept pace with demands of higher performance, lighter weight machines.  In fact, it has been almost 25 years since the last new magnetic material (NdFeB) became commercially available.  As hybrid and electric vehicles fill the streets, and wind power generation continues to be one of the fastest growing means of producing electricity, the demand for increased efficiency needs to be met with innovative new magnetic materials. Niron Magnetics is developing the world’s first advanced manufacturing process for the mass production of permanent magnets powered by our breakthrough material formulation.  Niron’s proprietary Iron nitride magnets possess inherently higher magnetization and can be produced at a lower cost compared to today’s rare-earth magnets, and will enable a revolution in the design of new electric motors and generators. Niron was founded in 2014 as a spinout of University of Minnesota and is based on technology that has received the support of ARPA-E, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences.",,"Greater Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Transportation",1,Jian-Ping Wang,11-50,6,,2022-11-22,17500000,USD,17500000,Grant,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,34099999,USD,34099999,51599999,USD,51599999,"US Department of Energy, University of Minnesota, Anzu Partners, Volvo Cars Tech Fund, Volta Energy Technologies",6,7,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-6.15%,42,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds can be engineered and linked together to bind with many molecular targets that today’s drugs can’t bind with, Cohen said. The key insight, he said, is that the scientific founders have discovered a way to bind with select disease-causing proteins, and flag them as cellular trash, so that the ordinary proteasome garbage disposal system can get rid of them. Selecting the precise disease-related proteins to send to the trash is obviously critical, because any drug like this could cause serious side effects if it sent healthy proteins involved in normal cell processes to the trash. C4 Therapeutics is developing a new class of targeted protein degradation (TPD) therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Our Degronimid™ platform incorporates highly selective small molecule binders to target disease-causing proteins and facilitate their rapid destruction and clearance from the cell through the natural ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Because of this distinctive mechanism, Degronimids are capable of hitting many more targets, including those previously thought to be undruggable, while reducing the potential for drug resistance. The broad applicability of Degronimids, and our chemical biology platform designed for accelerated validation, have the potential to make an unprecedented impact across many diseases through multiple industry collaborations as well as proprietary programs.

According to a disease statistics study released in 2004, atrial fibrillation is a very common chronic disease that occurs in 1 out of 4 people in their 40s or older. As stated in the Atrial Fibrillation Report from the UK's Atrial Fibrillation Association in 2012, the biggest problem is that atrial fibrillation is not diagnosed in 1 in 2 patients because it is not accompanied by severe subjective symptoms and hard to find due to the intermittent properties. To diagnose atrial fibrillation, the following three features of continuous monitoring are essential. Our product, CART, is equipped with these features to fully maximize the benefits of continuous monitoring. 1)	Comfortability as a wearable device : You can always wear CART on a daily basis. Additionally, it is even water-proof and dust-proof. So, you don't have to take it off while taking a shower, or washing hands. 2)	No-user intervention : By just wearing it on any finger which fits for you, every measurement is performed on the background basis without any intervention. 3)	Medical proof & Accuracy : Diagnosis is based on the conventional diagnosis method of cardiologists. By simply wearing CART on user's finger, CART continuously detects atrial fibrillation without any user intervention. CART detects and records atrial fibrillation, so users can track and manage their heart health status. In addition, users can diagnose atrial fibrillation whenever they want and see the results on their smartphone. By merely tapping CART, users can make event logs and analyze atrial fibrillation data at that moment when it occurs. Finally, the collected atrial fibrillation data can be used to help the physician diagnose of the atrial fibrillation. Initial target market is 0.2 million atrial fibrillation patients in Finland. Total target market is 300 million people to diagnose atrial fibrillation and tens of million subjects in clinical trials.
