You can now co-own a second home, in your favorite city, at a fraction of the price. A share of 1/12 gives you up to 30 days of stay annually in your city home. Want more? You can buy more shares! You own the asset, not a block of time. Flyway deals with all the hassle of ownership, so that you simply land and enjoy your city getaway. HOW WE DO IT BEHIND THE SCENES We identify top-notch properties, in top locations that we can supercharge with smart features. We then set up an LTD (Limited Liability Company) that acquires the property. That LTD is split into 12 equal shares, and each share costs 1/12 of the total house price. A buyer can buy up to half of the property (6 shares).  WHAT YOU GET You get ownership of a second home suited to your budget and needs. Whether you use it for leisure, work or you simply believe in the property’s potential as an investment, you have the rights to the asset. You can use and resell your share when you want. Meanwhile, you get to enjoy upscale, smart living in very prime properties, downtown, without any of the headaches of maintenance, cleaning and bill handling.

Because traditional pressure based microphones pick up sound coming from every direction, arrays of multiple microphones are needed to listen to a specific direction and ignore surrounding noise. This comes at a cost of increased size and decreased audio quality. Our bio-inspired, directional microphone directly measures the velocity of incoming sound rather than pressure. With a single microphone, we can separate sounds coming from multiple directions without compromising on size or quality.

This way, everyone in your organization knows exactly what to do to respond to this particular incident with the utmost efficiency. - ORNA’s simple-to-use Risk & Compliance and industry framework-adherent Report Builder features will help you prevent attacks, streamline reporting, and reduce cyber insurance premiums by guiding your organization through the NIST process in a much more straightforward manner than the framework itself. - ORNA's Playbook Community Marketplace allows organizations, consultants, and vendors to easily create, customize, share, and even sell cyber incident playbooks with other ORNA users.

In our quest to disrupt traditional healthcare – advancing it from the hospital, to home, to hand – we developed a groundbreaking solution to enable anyone with a smartphone to measure their ‘Vital Signs from Video Selfies’. From a simple 10-second face scan, our technology extracts 5 vital signs (heart rate, blood oxygen, pupillary reflex, eye saccades, hand tremor) – all familiar to clinicians for decades – to obtain insights into all 3 vital organs:  heart, lung, and brain.  We call this our ""Healthy Selfie,"" which you ironically naturally capture every day. After 30,000 human and machine hours of R&D, our AI-powered digital biomarker platform can now measure all 5 vital signs with a clinical validation accuracy over 90%, fortified by 7 utility patents, globally pending.   BioTrillion's longer-term roadmap is to digitally map the entire human body by developing more digital biomarkers to simultaneously measure additional vital signs, all from the same Healthy Selfie video – accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere.

This is commonly used for proactive maintenance, operational optimization, and to make your products more intuitive. The uniqueness, and the result of 7 years of machine learning research at the University of Borås in Sweden, is the ability to do this at the edge of the network, on the actual device. The benefits are significant. You can process all the data in real-time. More sensors equals more data, and the only way to manage this flood is through a layered approach that starts by the data source. You can take instant actions. You learn and act based on the normal condition of the individual device.

When you ask us what home is, we don’t have an easy answer. It’s complicated. We have the city we chose to live in and call home, and then we have our culture, the country we come from, which we call home as well. And it’s a big part of our identity, it’s who we are. Homeis was created to help people like us, who belong here and there, and feel that the Internet is undeserving them. We’ve witnessed how difficult it is for local foreign-born communities to digitally connect, share their culture, their local knowledge, and unique context. We saw how important these communities are in one’s life, how supportive they can be, and how effective their common wisdom can be to its members. So we decided it’s time to give foreign-born communities a dedicated comprehensive product. A product that understands them really well, and most importantly - empowers them. It’s what we’re here for. While local culture networks have always existed, our mission is to use technology and innovation to turn these invisible groups into visible communities. Homeis was founded in Feb 2017 in NYC and Tel Aviv. We’ve launched our first community in Dec 2017, and are planning to open many more in the next months.

OpenTaste is an innovative online marketplace for fresh food. It has built an effective perishable produce logistics service, gathering products from over 200 farms and food manufacturers across 6 countries, and growing. The company prides itself on delivering these products in the shortest possible time from farm to consumer, and at prices that are incredibly low. This unique online platform acts as a global farmer’s market, connecting consumers with farmers and foodmakers. At the click of a button, consumers can now buy farm-fresh produce, dairy, meat, seafood and pantry items directly from global sources at wholesale prices and have them delivered within 36 hours. How is this possible? Very simply, OpenTaste is not a food vendor or supermarket. Rather it is an innovative logistics enterprise built by a highly passionate team, developing technology and designing processes to extract efficiency at every point of the food supply chain. The just-in-time system, where produce is delivered directly to customers from the farms, is the key. All unnecessary intermediaries, like farm brokers, exporters, importers and distributors are eliminated, thus reducing costs and ensuring freshness. Food wastage levels are also extremely low, with a dump rate that is significantly lower than the industry average of 13%. The last mile solution where orders are packed and delivered to customers adds to the efficiency gains. Leveraging on their proprietary crowdsourcing system, members of the community with time to spare can sign up to pack or deliver orders to customers, earning additional income in doing so.  The end result? Consumers get more choices and at better prices, farmers get access to a bigger market, receive a fairer deal and is paid on time, and the community on the whole benefits from putting assets to work which would otherwise have been left idle.",https://www.facebook.com/opentastecom,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage",1,David Lee,251-500,2,Early Stage Venture,2021-06-06,50000000,USD,50000000,Series A,50000000,USD,50000000,Series A,52000000,USD,52000000,52000000,USD,52000000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,94.58%,7,3,"5,619",,,,,,,,

Everspin's unparalleled innovation has come from a simple, but unprecedented idea: If hacking occurs when enough time is given to hackers, why not cut down such time?  After years of R&D, Everspin has found a way to solve the fundamental problem that all of the existing mobile cybersecurity solutions entail: security modules are placed in the user’s app and they do not change until the app is updated, which inevitably renders mobile apps vulnerable to hacking.

It has rich functionality for every side of the market: buyers, sellers, and creators. More specifically, the token is used for: • Sending rewards • Payments on the marketplace • Discounts on transaction fees • Governance voting • Staking Together, this combination of functionalities should simultaneously provide ample velocity (through the use as rewards and payments) and remove excessive supply from the circulation (via staking). Fayre’s aim is to build a long term ecosystem. Short term an NFT Marketplace with 0% transaction fees. Medium term providing utility and governance via the $FAYRE token. And long term building of Web3 modular components and P2E functionality on the Metaverse.  Fayre was founded by Luis Carranza and Fernando Torres.

In addition, due to the global trend of shorter hospital stays after birth, there is now a large unmet need for tools to follow-up jaundice in families' homes.

Its patented technology is a game-changer in the wind energy sector; it uses 90% less material while being twice as efficient than existing technology. Unlike conventional wind turbines, the Kitepower system does not require resource-intensive towers or heavy foundations and is thus easy to transport and deploy. The system is able to harness stronger and more persistent winds at higher altitudes, allowing for capacity factors greater than 0.5 and in return cost-effective electricity generation, this opens up new geographical markets for the generation of wind energy. The 100kW system currently in development is ideally suited to replace diesel generator sets in remote locations to save costs and mitigate dependency on diesel supply. Kitepower was founded by Johannes Peschel and Roland Schmehl in January 2016 as a result of the work done by TU Delft’s pioneering kite power research group of the former astronaut Wubbo Ockels.
