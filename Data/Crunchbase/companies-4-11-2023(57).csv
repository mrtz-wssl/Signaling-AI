SoleGATE is the disruptive cyber protection software platform by Solebit, challenging the norms of currently available technologies that rely on slow, costly and mostly outdated, ineffective methods of sandboxing, signatures and behavioral inspection. The solution is powered by DvC™ (data vs. code), a patented, real-time, signature-less engine. DvC assumes that there is no legitimate reason for executable code to be present in any data file. As such, it does not rely on heuristics or behaviors (which are core limitations of competing technologies), and definitively identifies and terminates any instance of malicious code such as hidden CPU instructions,  encrypted and polymorphic payloads, shellcodes and other commands typically buried in data file. DvC also accurately identifies an blocks malicious active content using advanced flow analysis, de-obfuscation techniques and deep content evaluation, to reveal threat intent within any inbound data file covering machine, operating system and application levels, thereby rendering such sandbox evading attacks harmless to the enterprise. Solebit was founded in 2014 by a team of world-class cybersecurity experts, all graduates of the elite technology units in the Israel Defense Forces with years of experience in offensive and defensive security. It counts a variety of leading global financial organizations, tech, defense contractors, security vendors, cloud and telecom service providers as active customers.

CanvasFlip is a cloud-based design collaboration and testing platform, enabling designers to create design prototype and capture analytics right on their designs. They want to make a better world where digital consumers don’t have to struggle to use the app. They look forward to achieving it by helping designers validate their ideas early and frequently. They build CanvasFlip because almost all alternate user testing tools were very expensive and time taking and running a test with them was a nightmare. CanvasFlip is started by 2 friends - Vipul Mishra and Manish Jha who were trying to build and validate earlier products. Since none of the prototyping tools provided analytics back then and user testing was extremely expensive and cumborsome, CanvasFlip was founded to make a seamless and cost-effective way to validate ideas at design stage.",https://www.facebook.com/canvasflip,Asia-Pacific (APAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Other, Software",2,"Manish Jha, Vipul Mishra",1-10,1,M&A,2015-09-14,1200000,USD,1200000,Seed,1200000,USD,1200000,Seed,1200000,USD,1200000,1200000,USD,1200000,"Bessemer Venture Partners, Microsoft Accelerator Bangalore",,2,,Was Acquired,2019-09-17,day,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,3,,22,,,,,,,

ARED started as a Research Lab in 2013, our goal was to help bridge the digital divide that affects over 4 billion people across the world. Most of the investment in the digital divide is focused on bandwidth, yet most of the storage and computing power is controlled by 3 main companies and centralized infrastructure is very expensive. Also, most of the smartphones in developing countries are low-end smartphones with low internal memory and low processing power that accentuate the digital divide. Finally, lack of energy access is a huge problem, if you do not have electricity at home you cannot charge your phone and use it the way you want, also building storage and computing power solution require energy that is why at ARED we use renewable energy.  To solve this digital divide, ARED developed a mini-server platform to store digital applications closer to the users and minimize the cost of the internet, and we developed a solar kiosk platform to power the technology but also provide additional services such as phone charging to become a one-stop-shop platform.  We spent 6 years developing the technology, and in 2020 we started piloting our technology in 6 African countries with local partners (Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Burkinafaso, and Ivory Coast).

We have an innovative solution that flips the script on the usual question “what makes people leave?”, and instead asks “what makes people stay?”.  We’ve built a platform specifically designed to make it easier for organizations to create a workplace where people want to stay.  With our solution, healthcare organizations are better able to:  * know your people, and build strong relationships with them  * Reduce friction/frustration in clinician’s workflow by eliminating wasteful administrative tasks * support your people more effectively in their career development ** All while dramatically reducing the amount of time your clinicians and your administrative team is spending on manual data entry and paper pushing. **  How We Do It:  DoorSpace’s SaaS platform provides an intelligent data management system, enabling clinicians and their employers to collaborate, manage and maintain mission-critical personnel data.  DoorSpace provides a “single source of truth” that is updated in real-time across the organization each time an employee’s data file changes. We provide organizations with the workforce data they need to make data-driven decisions, and we reduce the time high-value talent is spending on low-value administrative tasks.  The immediate value DoorSpace provides our customers is that we clean up a lot of back office ""clutter"", automating the ongoing organization and maintenance of personnel data and documents.  The long term value DoorSpace provides to healthcare leaders is transparency across their workforce with real-time reporting and superior data accuracy, enabling better, faster decisions.  Specific Pain Points We Address:    * Clinicians and administrators wasting valuable time pushing paper and manually moving data from one silo’d system to another;    * Healthcare leaders wait months to get reports on the state of their workforce, delaying the resolution of serious problems until after impacted clinicians have quit;    * Inability to quickly identify clinician’s strengths and weaknesses to ensure strengths are leveraged while bolstering weaknesses with the right training;    * Delays that are weeks and often months long in getting things done - from placing a new clinician to billing insurance companies and every step along the way, back office inefficiencies      are costing organizations time and money they can’t afford to spend;   * Employers need to both ramp up recruiting to keep staff - ratios, and they need to increase investment in retention with limited resources;    * Growing turnover and no insights or clear strategic retention plan beyond paying clinicians more money;   * Growing frustration among clinicians, especially doctors and nurses, which has led to an increase in medical errors, nurse strikes, turnover, and disengagement from patient care work;",https://www.facebook.com/doorspaceinc,"Greater Houston Area, Southern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Administrative Services, Apps, Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Health Care, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Brian White, Sarah Worthy",1-10,2,Seed,2023-02-01,300000,USD,300000,Seed,300000,USD,300000,Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,MassChallenge,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,1,,17,0,2,,Scientific and technological services,,,

The company's first product is noc™ - a video communication tool, scientifically designed to minimise the cognitive effort of context-switching between tasks and calls. By minimising the cognitive load on the human brain, users are able to communicate more naturally whilst maintaining focus on their current task. This results in reduced mental exhaustion (""Zoom fatigue""), fewer incidences of miscommunication, improved productivity, innovation, and staff retention. The product also uses natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to summarise conversational content and deliver live, unbiased operational data to business leaders. After a call, the NLP transcript is compressed by the AI into a bullet-pointed summary of the conversation. For larger companies, the AI compresses all conversation data to present a live operational dashboard to senior leadership, helping them make more informed decisions. The company has been awarded grant funding by the EU's Regional Development Fund and Innovate UK's Transformative Technologies Fund for research into the effects of remote communication on mental health, productivity and innovation, as well as its contribution towards net zero carbon emissions by reducing the demand for travel. The product was created by thought-leading user experience designers, MBA graduates and PhD neuroscientists from Cranfield University, The University of Bristol and University College London to fill a gap in the remote comms market for instant, casual communication with distant colleagues.
