Our Vision  Our vision of the future, is in which, urban cities around the world are operating efficiently, sustainably and liveable. We envision QIQ to be a platform of change in the transportation sector in urban cities, improving millions of lives.  Our Mission  To inspire greater living and connectivity between people, goods and services by providing transportation technology that is designed and built for the masses living in urban cities.  Our Values  1. Serve the People  We pledge to remember that at the end of the day, we are building the company, innovating in technology and providing services to make the world a better place.  2. Openness and Transparency  We will promote an open culture that encourages teamwork and trust. We believe in trying new things, testing, failing, tweaking and learning. We believe that everything can be improved and overcome.  3. Advancing Innovation and Technology  We will never stop innovating and advancing technology to improve lives or people living in the Urban Community. Our criteria for the building the best product, rest on functions, reliability, safety and friendly to all ages and gender.  4. Equal Partnerships  We believe that all partnerships both internal and external are important. We promise to treat all form of partnership with respect, fairness and integrity - expecting the same in return	 			 5. Dream Never stop dreaming. Never stop believing. Never stop Trying.  Executive Summary QIQ (pronounced as “KIK”) is a Singapore Headquartered Technology Company that is making its mission to “reimagine urban transportation” for the global industry. Its aim is to make transportation shared, greener and more accessible to the masses and in return, relieve the overburdened public transport systems of cities worldwide by working with governments around the world, private landowners, and transport operators, creating their own ecosystem of shared electric vehicles. We believe that today’s electric vehicles of different classes are not designed to be robust, reliable for a sharing economy.  Based on QIQ’s new Ultra-Dense Energy Capacitor Technology, we have invented two different lightweight vehicles such as the electric bicycle and scooters (PMDs) that can be fully charged in minutes. Today, we are reimagining how future last-mile electric shared vehicles would look, designed for all ages and city conditions, hence the development of a Semi-Autonomous Platooning POD. (See attached Image)  Our technological offering consists of a complete end-to-end service solution which includes a cloud-based Vehicle Cloud Command & Control System (VCCS) that can remotely collect all vehicle telematics and traffic condition data. Our lightweight vehicles such as the electric bicycle and scooters are ideal for new deployment in cities that are looking for a simple and clean deployment with charging docking stations. By 2021, QIQ’s Semi-Autonomous Platooning POD will be fully functional and ready for on-road deployment and would be an ideal system for urban cities looking to provide car-sharing and logistic vehicle options.  So why is QIQ a company that pledges to “reimagine urban transportation?” That is because we believe that people's lives will be improved when smarter mobility options are introduced and people/goods and services are connected 24/7 through sustainable transportation technologies.",https://www.facebook.com/QIQGLOBAL/,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy, Information Technology, Transportation",1,Justin Sim,11-50,1,Seed,2018-06-26,1000000,USD,1000000,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,Stellar Venture Partners,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,,,

Domestically, TRW has won the Malaysia Super League Championship on 2 occasions, most recently in the 2012 season, 2 Malaysia Cup titles, 2 Malaysia FA Cup titles, 1 Charity Shield, and 1 Malaysia Premier League title. 2012 was their debut playing in the AFC Cup. They played well in the group stage to gain first place. However, the team lost in the quarter-final to Erbil SC.  On 6 September 2020, Kelantan FA was privatized and is now owns by Norizam Tukiman, Group CEO of Unclezam Holding Berhad Group of Companies for RM 6.8 million. The reason he purchases the club is to save the club from bankruptcy with former player debts that too high. For 2021, as part of the effort to revamp Kelantan FC and also to bring the Club back to its glory days, Norizam Tukiman reshuffle the whole structure of the Club from the coaching staff to the players. Almost 90% of the players for 2021 season are new players and the native of Kelantan. Kelantan FC also successfully appointed a new line-up of the coaching staff, led by Marco Ragini, to install Italian DNA in Kelantan FC. Apart from restructuring the Club’s line-up, the Management also had taken an effort to slowly acquire assets for the Club such as TRW Hotel & a 4 wheel-drive. The club aims to be qualified in the Malaysian Super League by the year 2024. On 3 May 2021, in one of the most shocking news both in Malaysia and Indonesia, Kelantan FC’s owner, Norizam Tukiman makes another move to expand his empire by purchasing an Indonesia club, PSPS Riau which currently competes in Liga 2, Indonesia. The acquisition opens up opportunities for both Kelantan FC and PSPS Riau to establish long-term cooperation for the mutual benefits of both Clubs.",https://www.facebook.com/trwkelantanfc,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sports,1,Norizam Tukiman,11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,2021-05-01,360000,USD,360000,Series A,360000,USD,360000,Series A,1360000,USD,1360000,1360000,USD,1360000,MRI VC Berhad,1,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,

We offer simple, reliable, and sustainable services for the everyday cyclist who are looking for a more convenient and functioning bicycle life. MIOO contributes to sustainable and healthy cities by enabling billions of kilometers of mobility by pure pedal power! MARKET Cycling is growing rapidly with 2B bikes in the world and +100M sold bikes per year. Bicycle commuting is exploding in large cities through new bike lanes, healthier lifestyles and environmental consciousness. Copenhagen and Amsterdam have close to  50% mobility by bicycle. Paris, London and Stockholm are quickly catching up from 10% levels. Cycling delivers several 100 times more mobility in kilometers than all E-scooters and other mobility companies all together.  IMPACT Bikes are the most efficient, sustainable and healthy way of transportation up to 30km and it is an effective solution for several global challenges. A bicycle emits only 3g of CO2 per km. An everyday cyclist shows a 40% lower mortality risk. PROBLEM  Bicycle sales are moving online. The 20% CAGR of online sales before Covid-19 is now accelerating fast, expected to reach 40% of all sales in many countries by 2025. The shift to online sales requires new types of solutions for customer support and service of the bike. Customers wait on average 12 days to get the bike fixed and even finding a nearby bike repair shop is hard. Millions of bicycles are left in sheds or garages with simpler problems. Millions of bicycles are also reported stolen and rarely get back to the owners even if the Police finds it. People stop biking due to this, leaving all the impacts disabled.  SOLUTION MIOO offers a solution to all this by establishing a  “service & safety” relationship with the user from when the bicycle is unpacked from a delivery box until the bike is sold. PRODUCT / APP - Bicycle service where you are - Assemble your newly online-purchased bike at your doorstep  - Anti theft registration and Bike-id-labeling - Bicycle insurance  - Service book  - Digital and secure change of ownership - IoT ready for Smart locks and GPS - Service and Safety subscription single or family plan BUSINESS MODEL On-demand services act as profitable funnel into a recurring subscriptions 100€ in yearly recurring revenues per user from subscriptions and on-demand sales of service and safety.

Nowadays, in most properties, the physical security hardware systems such as Access Control, Alarm Systems, CCTV, sensors, and more, are poorly managed. The traditional physical security infrastructure fails to deliver, it is under-protected and underperforming, and unlike any other security aspect in the organization, the physical security still has critical Cyber Risks and Weaknesses.

Last but not least, current systems still missing the technological leverage to support and empower the human factor in the physical security operation. Here is how Keer can revolutionize your organization with its unique cutting-edge technology. Keer will unify all your Physical Security Hardware into one smart, simple and robust system. It will easily and automatically Plug-N-Play to all your Physical Security assets and will connect them all into one smart mesh.

Our long-term vision is to build a major global veterinary medical rehabilitation company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of products for the treatment of orthopedic, pain and other rehabilitative conditions for all animals.  We plan to accomplish this vision by finding, licensing, and/or acquiring existing medical device technologies which have already been deployed and proven in the human space, with appropriate modifications for use in the veterinary space. In August of 2015, we secured an exclusive five-year worldwide license from DJO Global (DJO), a major player in the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of medical devices and equipment. The license is for use in animals of the patented thermoformable bracing technology original developed by Exos Corporation. In January of 2016, we acquired OrthoCor Medical, Inc. OrthoCor was an orthopedic medical device company with pain management technology for treating chronic joint pain. We acquired the company so that we could use its technology for creating devices to alleviate chronic pain in animals using its patented PEMF technology. In May of 2016, we acquired Animal OrthoCare, LLC.  Animal OrthoCare is a veterinary custom bracing company focused on creating customized support braces for companion animals.

We believe in owning the full stack from the lowest levels of software to the actual hardware. We design and produce robots under one roof to accelerate our iteration cycle. Our integration starts all the way from the firmware to the electricial engineering to the actual assembly of the robot. Foundational to our mission is the ability for the robot to see the world in 3D using just regular cameras. We developed a neural network to see the world in depth using stereo cameras and a SLAM system to locate our robot in 3D space. We believe that the fastest and the most robust way to learn about the world is through interaction. When our robot encounters a novel object, it can move around to observe the object from different angles and viewpoints to acquire more data. Matician is led by repeat founders Navneet Dalal and Mehul Nariyawala. Navneet has a PhD in Computer Vision and is perhaps best known for his thesis, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), a landmark in computer vision research, which remained the state-of-the-art for 10 years with over 35,000 citations. Navneet and Mehul were early employees at a startup called Like.com, which pioneered facial recognition in images in 2005 and was acquired by Google in 2010. Next, they started Flutter (Y Combinator W12), a startup that built on-device hand-gesture recognition. The algorithms worked locally on the device using the webcam with just an 800kB footprint. And yet, Flutter beat the state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and recall, leading to its acquisition by Google in 2013. At the time of acquisition, Flutter was the #1 Mac Store app in 73 countries and its users had performed over 77 million gestures. At Google, they helped launch Google Cardboard at Google Research. Later, the team moved over to Nest where Mehul was the Lead PM for Nest Cam and Navneet led the algorithms team. The team conceptualized and launched Nest Cam Outdoor, Nest Cam IQ, and Nest Hello Doorbell along with other computer vision features such as person and stranger detection. In 2017, Mehul and Navneet returned to the startup world, co-founding Matician. They have since grown the team to over 25, including Google, Tesla, and Cisco alumni, all working together to bring the vision of home autonomy into the hands of our customers.",,"San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",2,"Mehul Nariyawala, Navneet Dalal",11-50,1,Seed,2019-01-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Twin Ventures,,1,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,-11.8%,24,,,7,3,0,"Furniture,Domestic Articles Or Appliances; Coffee Mills; Spice Mills",Machines and machine tools,39931,USD,39931

We offer different payment options including monthly instalments and no-interest financing.  The Care Now Pay Later model is a relatively new concept in the Asian market, so there are not many direct competitors yet. However, there are a number of companies that offer similar services, such as: Atome: Atome is a Singapore-based BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online and offline purchases. It is currently available in 7 countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Hoolah: Hoolah is an Australian BNPL company that offers instalment plans for online and offline purchases. It is currently available in Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand.

These companies all offer similar services to Care Now Pay Later, but they may have different features and fees. It is important to compare the different options available before choosing a BNPL provider. The Care Now Pay Later model is still a relatively new concept in the Asian market, so it is likely that more competitors will emerge in the future. This is because the BNPL market is growing rapidly in Asia, and there is a demand for more flexible payment options. We can capture a significant share of the $600M billion dollar care market in Asia. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $914 billion by 2030.
