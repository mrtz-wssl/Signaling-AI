Mitochondria are at the heart of complex life's origin. Likely a bacterium at the time, the would-be-organelle merged with a simple organism, entering into a symbiotic relationship: The mitochondria began supplying the energy for elaborate cellular functions to evolve, while the organism provided the mitochondria with an environment to thrive. Today, mitochondria are found in all human cells, except for red blood cells. They take on a pivotal role in cellular fate, as they produce most of the energy (ATP) and are involved in a large number of cellular and metabolic processes. The density of the organelles is particularly high in cells requiring a lot of cellular energy - e.g. cardiomyocytes or brain cells. Mitochondria function, and hence energy supply to the cell, may be impaired due to acute insults (e.g. ischemia) or genetic disorders (e.g. LOHN). Researchers at Harvard University developed an approach for mitochondria augmentation and replacement to ameliorate the damages from ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Ischemia is a lack of blood flow leading to an undersupply of oxygen and an impairment of mitochondria function. Reperfusion describes the re-introduction of blood flow, inducing an oversupply of oxygen. Both, ischemia and reperfusion, damage cells, with the mitochondria dysfunction being at the heart of the injury. The cascade of events, from ischemia to reperfusion, will eventually lead to cell death. The most prominent acute conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury are heart attacks. At Cellvie, we are developing a means to transplant viable mitochondria into the compromised cells, to interrupt the said cascade of events, re-enabling the cells to turn oxygen into energy via the mitochondria.",1-10,2.0,Seed,2023-02-06,5500000.0,Seed,10500000.0,4.0,1-10,Private,,,2.0,0.0,Biochemistry; Beer; Spirits; Wine; Vinegar; Microbiology; Enzymology; Mutation Or Genetic Engineering,0,5,2018,6559,True

Qube Money is a budget and banking based on the most successful behavior-changing budgeting method ever - cash envelopes. This unique banking experience maintains purpose and connection with the user's money plan or budget with each transaction.  This fundamentally changes the users' relationship with money resulting in greater savings and the consistent achievement of goals. The app modernizes the outdated envelope budgeting system of previous generations by digitizing budgets into “qubes”. Consumers then set limits for different qube budgets, like groceries, clothing, and entertainment.  A physical Qube Money debit card gives shoppers access to their pre-budgeted qube funds. This unique budgeting app helps consumers avoid overspending. When money in a qube is insufficient, shoppers are empowered to make in-the-moment budgeting choices about a purchase. The app is engineered to support a variety of budgeting dynamics in the household. Couples can choose Qube Companion Cards to strengthen financial transparency and keep open communication about shared budgets. Qube Money also offers an effective tool for families to track spending across different family members. With the help of Kid Cards, parents and children learn about responsible spending habits together.  FREEING people from the tyranny of money by breaking the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and eliminating personal debt is the heart of Qube Money. Qube Money is available to qualifying customers in the U.S. To learn more about the innovative app, visit the Qube Money website.

The goal of our AI Squared technology is to level this playing field by providing AI integration technologies that would increase AI adoption and enable access to AI for anyone. This is our story. Dr. Benjamin Harvey was the Chief of Operations Data Science at NSA where he experienced challenges first-hand associated with the inability to adopt AI,  provide equitable access to AI, and unlock the value of AI for intelligence analysts and the military warfighter.  His inspiration came from his two brothers who were Army officers recently deployed to the Middle East (Kuwait, Iraq and Qatar) and SW Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan) who both relied on intelligence to achieve mission. He began a journey and developed a solution to solve these inequities that simplifies and accelerates AI integration into applications ultimately protecting lives of Americans and military warfighters in similar situations as his brothers.   Our vision is to build the world’s most powerful model integration framework and AI integration software which enables any application to become AI-powered. For the first time ever data scientists can describe their models using our model integration framework and our AI integration software will overlay intelligence from inference results directly into a pre-existing web application.

Taelor is a revolutionary new way for men to rent clothes, allowing them to look and feel great every day while also reducing their carbon footprint. The service uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence and personal stylists to select clothes for men based on their sizes and personal preferences. The clothes are shipped directly to customers, who can either wear them for two weeks and return them or purchase the clothes for up to 70% off the regular retail price. Customers then receive another box of clothes. “Our goal is to provide individuals with stylish, everyday menswear. We believe that every day is an opportunity to look good and feel confident,” said Cheng, a former digital product lead at Facebook, eBay and Target. “And when you rent clothes instead of buying them, you not only save the time and energy of having to search and shop for clothes, but you also help the environment, too, instead of purchasing clothes that will eventually end up in a landfill.” Cheng has a strong background in both the digital and retail space. A TEDx Talk speaker and best-selling book author, Cheng spent 15 years leading digital innovation teams at Facebook, eBay, Target, McDonald’s and Sears before launching Taelor. Cheng said she originally got the idea to start a clothing rental subscription service for men after becoming a huge fan of other clothing rental subscription services herself. “I became such a fan of renting clothes that I haven’t purchased any clothes for myself except for underwear for the past five years,” Cheng says. “But I realized that none of the clothing rental services really served menswear nor focuses on helping people to achieve career or personal goals in their everyday life, and I thought, men should be able to enjoy this service too so they can feel ready and confident for their day.”  The popularity of sustainability practices, minimalism, and no-ownership trends have caused the clothing rental business model to explode in recent years, with some analysts projecting that the Circular Fashion industry, which includes rental and resale, could earn as much as $66 billion by 2024 in the U.S. alone. Taelor gives customers the option to choose between two different subscription packages. The first option is a flat, monthly fee, where customers get two boxes per month, which include four shirts per box. The second option is for customers to pay a one-time fee, where customers receive three boxes in total, with four shirts per box. Both options include complimentary personalized styling, dry cleaning, and shipping both ways — making the process of renting and returning clothing easy and effortless. It’s a service that is a perfect solution for busy individuals who don’t want to spend time shopping or picking out their clothes. “I want to look good, but I don't really want to spend time shopping,” says Danny Ma, one of Taelor’s first customers. “I considered clothing subscription boxes for years, but I didn’t want to commit to buying something from each box. After using Taelor, I am much more confident!”  For more information about Taelor, please visit https://taelor.style.
