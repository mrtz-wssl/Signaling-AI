These take under 5 minutes to post, and have zero obligation. In addition to the immediate benefits, companies can identify and evaluate job candidates, including those from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, and authentically assess job skills, cultural fit, and non-cognitive traits (e.g. grit, communication, teamwork, etc.). For college students and recent grads, Parker Dewey provides the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and grit, explore careers, develop their networks, and generate income as they seek internships and full-time roles. Furthermore, these authentic, experiential learning opportunities complement in-class instruction, thereby improving academic performance and driving completion. As a result, career launchers graduate more job-ready, and have the perspective and experience to find a full-time role with the right skill and cultural fit. Using data from these projects, Parker Dewey also provides insights to college and university faculty so that they can better align curriculum with job skills demanded by companies. In addition, these academic institutions can more effectively engage alumni and professors as mentors, counsel students on career options, and support existing and / or prospective corporate recruiters.

For buyers and sellers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility technologies that reduce waste, cost, and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech, and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target, and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills we honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impacts. Our social mission: to keep food, medicines and other critical perishables out of landfills.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and launched as a social purpose corp (C-corp) in 2020.  PROBLEM Supply chain data technologies have been underfunded for generations — still largely powered by paper, faxes and disconnected systems. These antiquated approaches were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Paper systems mean shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges, including AI, IoT, 5G, printed electronics, and machine vision. SOLUTIONS We bring both software and hardware solutions to the market to reduce cost, waste, and risk in perishable supply chains.  -- PRODUCT 1: The Transparent Path Visibility Platform (PaaS). Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity, and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product customers are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball.""  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value.  -- PRODUCT 2: FreshScore™ - our patented predictive freshness algorithm targeted at buyers. FreshScore uses both production data and supply chain environmental data to predict the freshness of perishables before they arrive at retail. This unique algorithm arms food producers with quality control data, allowing for the routing of the best product to the best customers, minimizing surprises and rejections. It also helps reduce waste by anticipating freshness and viability issues before they occur. We are partnering with ReFED, the top food waste non-profit, to bring this technology to market. -- PRODUCT 3: ProofScore™ - our ""credit score for transparency."" ProofScore is a patented algorithm that scores perishable producers and products based on data transparency. The more data shared with supply chain partners and consumers, the higher the ProofScore.  ProofScore puts information into the hands of consumers, answering the question, where did this product come from? How did it get to me? What happened to it along the way? ProofScore-ranked products can command higher margins and grow stronger customer satisfaction. We are partnering with a large Japanese multinational firm on its development.  -- PRODUCT 4: ProofTracker - our eco-friendly sensor device. This advanced temperature/humidity/shock tracker is a cellular gateway built on biodegradable materials.    BENEFITS Our products reduce customers' supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. They also reduce negative impacts to natural capital, including keeping food and perishables out of landfills. Using our system, all supply chain partners know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes while improving collaboration and trust. And customer relationships are maximized by the delivery of fresh, safe products at full margin.  CUSTOMER PROFILE Transparent Path technologies support food, pharmaceuticals, blood/plasma, transplant organs, and construction chemical shipments. The company also currently provides asset tracking for high-end hard goods.  PARTNERSHIPS Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Duke University, and ReFED. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. We are working with Second Sun Laboratories to develop the most advanced hardware in the market, and with a large multinational Japanese tech manufacturer to develop ProofScore.  ACCELERATORS/INCUBATORS Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT.  FUNDRAISING To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, three grants, and four angel investors. In April 2023, the company was awarded grants totaling $440,000 from the National Science Foundation, ReFED, and the State of Washington. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.   FOR MORE INFORMATION Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business. His executive team includes senior leaders from Amazon, General Mills, Microsoft, Target, KraftHeinz, Xerox PARC, and the University of California at Berkeley.

Our unique system uses the magic of magnets to get rid of all those messy charging wires forever. Described as an alternative to messy, wire-laden charging systems, this family of chargers relies on the power of magnets to link together, like Lego, providing a charging solution that is efficient and very easy on the eyes. The Magfast Family comes with six chargers, covering every charging situation, and promises easy and quick charging for all your mobile devices. All of Magfast’s power banks come with a self-storing and replaceable built-in cable, traditional USB-A and new USB-C outlets, as well as wireless charging. While each individual Mgafast charger can work on its own, the system’s modular design allows you to connect multiple units together for “easy and rapid charging without wires.” There’s the LifeCharger, a portable powerbank that is easy to charge and can easily charge any device, all while fitting in the palm of your hand. Then, there’s the LifeCharger Extreme, which boasts the maximum power allowed by FAA law — that’s enough to jump start your car. Then, you have the RoadCharger, which when plugged into your 12v outlet gives you 4 USB outlets for you and your carmates to charge your devices with. As for AirCharger, this device supports wireless charging, and promises to be “perfect for the kitchen or office.” The WallCharger claims to provide a station for wireless charging not only for your mobile devices, but for the whole family of Magfast chargers as well. And finally, if you have an Apple Watch, the TimeCharger is for you. “There’s two problems with most chargers today,” said Seymour Segnit, Magfast founder and CEO. “They’re ugly with all those messy wires, which is no good in your environment — and most are so cheaply made they quickly go to landfill, which is really bad for everyone’s environment.” “Magfast is changing charging for good with world-class design and the best manufacturing, so these products will really last,” Segnit continued.

We have now acquired our first two assets to treat devastating diseases that currently are severely inadequately treated. Our focus is on novel compounds that: 1) have platform capability where one molecule can treat multiple diseases with severe unmet clinical need, 2) will get preferred regulatory treatment due to the high unmet need and breakthrough potential, and 3) need relatively small clinical trials to achieve approval. Our 1st in class gene therapy (ET-101) has been engineered to overexpress Caveolin-1, which organizes & regulates synaptic receptors essential for neuromuscular signaling and function. It can treat a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases through precise, targeted overexpression of Caveolin-1 in neurons . We are also advancing a new generation of tissue factor (TF) therapies (ET-201) – therapeutics designed to target the cell surface receptor now known to be prevalent on solid tumor cells, tumor vasculature, and tumor stem cells, but absent on normal cells. By targeting these proteins which play a central role in the pathology of inflammation and angiogenesis, we can stop tumor growth, spread, and recurrence. Our first indications are neurodegenerative diseases and cancers with high unmet need and high mortality (e.g. ALS and triple negative breast cancer). A robust pipeline of additional indications (e.g. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, etc. for ET-101; ovarian cancer, melanoma, etc. for ET-201) with severely inadequate treatment options will subsequently be pursued with these therapeutics.",,"Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Bruce Halpryn, Samuel Lee",1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,2021-05-06,3176754,USD,3176754,Series A,3176754,USD,3176754,Series A,5976754,USD,5976754,5976754,USD,5976754,"CincyTech, JobsOhio, Rev1 Ventures, Elk Capital Ventures",1,4,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32,,,,0,0,,"Pharmaceutical, veterinary and sanitary products",,,

Plcoskin’s scaffolds are made with synthetic PCL, a biodegradable material that is commonly used to create surgical sutures. Unlike competitors' products that remain in the body for a lifetime, Plcoskin’s PCL scaffolds are absorbed and replaced with the recipient’s own natural tissues, minimizing the possibility of long-term side effects. As they do not contain any dangerous chemicals, they are also 50% safer than cadaver-sourced scaffolds. Costs for reconstructive breast surgery are brought down by 40% to only $3 thousand per breast. Furthermore, much less handling time is required, reducing average surgery durations from an hour and a half to only 30 minutes. The mesh design of the scaffolds mitigates the need for an additional follow-up reconstructive surgery, something that is common when using cadaver-sourced scaffolds.

This game-changing solution has helped customers unlock new levels of performance from composites, enabling them to manufacture lighter, more cost-effective products that perform better than ever before. Originally a spin-out company from the University of Bristol, iCOMAT has developed a patented manufacturing process for advanced carbon fibre composites which are lighter, stronger & more cost-effective than the state-of-the-art processes for the aerospace, automotive & marine sectors. iCOMAT’s innovative technology, Rapid Tow Shearing (RTS), is the world’s first automated composites manufacturing process that can place carbon fibre tapes along curved paths without generating defects. Its defect-free fibre steering capability realises ultra lightweight composite structures beyond the limit of the conventional straight fibre designs & complex geometry which is not manufacturable using current automated manufacturing technologies. Unique in the world of automated composite manufacturing, iCOMAT’s technology is set to revolutionise transport, driving performance & cost-benefits across multiple markets such as aerospace & automotive.  Beyond state-of-the-art lightweighting solutions  - Composite materials are anisotropic, they are only strong in the direction of their fibres. iCOMAT’s specialist technology steers the path of fibres, enabling optimisation of mechanical properties at any point of the structure & ultimately improve all aspects of structural performance. This produces lighter, more efficient components & uses material only where needed in the most efficient way so use of raw materials & overall production costs are drastically reduced.
