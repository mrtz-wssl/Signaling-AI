A client-side application based on existing infrastructure, Button is built on Telegram messenger with principles of decentralization. Button focuses on optimizing usability and security for users looking to split the finances of shared experiences with friends. A good use case is friends sharing housing, ticket and dining expenses (like Coachella) within an existing group chat, like Telegram. Whether needs are compensating someone for a small freelance gig, tipping a barista, or sharing a meal with friends, Button users can send funds to their friends using only Telegram usernames. The Venmo for crypto, the bot has gained 150k users since launching in Q4 of 2018.  Our Telegram wallet allows anyone in the world to easily hold digital assets or exchanges cryptocurrency or tokens. Button’s Telegram wallet supports BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ETC, Waves, Stellar Lumens (XLM) and ERC-20 tokens. US users may also purchase cryptocurrency with fiat money (US Dollars). Telegram TON investors anticipate the release of TON (Telegram Open Network) grows as $1.7B has been invested into Telegram via Grams. Button Wallet will prepare for this by facilitating the exchange of grams for other cryptocurrencies.  Overall, buying cryptocurrency can be confusing for users. Sometimes it can take up to three weeks to be verified for a new user to purchase crypto with fiat within the US. With the integration of Wyre into the wallet, users in the U.S. can become verified to purchase cryptocurrency with a debit card usually within one hour.

In 2017, Mr. Xu Hongjun, co-founder and former vice president of Mobike, who had been in charge of hardware developing and manufacturing, founded Hongji Bike. His entrepreneur partner includes Mr. Wang Chao, designer of the classic Mobike model and founder of Kaiyun Motors. After Mobike was acquired by Meituan, most engineers from the Wuxi hardware team also joined Hongji Bike. At the China Cycle 2019, the largest bicycle fair in China that will be held in Shanghai this May, Hongji Bike will showcase its overall solutions for shared-mobility and custom-made / high-end bikes for both corporate customers and individual consumers, along with a gold prize-winning bike model at this fair. As Mobike and OFO quickly blossomed in China and across the globe, new competitors from other parts of the world have entered the market. The solution that Hongji Bike is going to display at the fair has been proved effective through our cooperation with many shared mobility startup companies worldwide. In May 2018, Hongji Bike received an order of 40,000 E-scooters from Lime, a shared mobility company based in North America. In around a month, Hongji Bike finished design, modeling, production and exportation, tackling Lime's urgent need of supply. After the Lime project, Hongji Bike broke the ice and attracted various shared mobility operators, to become its new customers, providing them with E-scooter, E-Bike and traditional shaft-driven bicycles. Xu Hongjun believes that Hongji possesses the capability to develop motors and control system, and is able to independently develop and manufacture system control units. It can deliver products with an appropriate and flexible cost under the rigorous requirements of the shared mobility market. Also, Hongji Bike is an expert in mass-production with its own factories and sophisticated supply system, able to react quickly to buyers' needs. Furthermore, Hongji Bike is engaged in exporting solutions for multiple shared mobility scenarios including in-park transportation, as well as providing services in product design, engineering technologies and manufacturing. And in the future, it is going to launch high-end bikes targeted at the European consumer market.

Through our experience we discovered number of deep problems that Brokers are struggling with including constant battle for Trading Volume, Customer (Trader) Retention and inability to utilize enormous trading data they have. To solve those major issues, we have started a whole new eco-system named SoFinX (Social Financial Exchange) to equip Brokers and Retail Investors with variety of tools dedicated to making wiser Trading Decisions and Strengthen Relationships. The concept of this SoFinX eco-system is based on “Social Trading without barriers”, meaning that Traders and Brokerages are not limited to only their own Brokerage but can access a network of decentralized Signals (”Trading signal providers”). A Trader can be a member of “Brokerage A” and still able to follow/copy other Traders from “Brokerage B/C/D” and build their own Trading portfolio based on proven results of professional Signal Providers. Signal providers on the other hand can share their Signals with the entire market and become their own fund, earning profit shares from their followers. We see this as a Financial Version of “ Airbnb” , which can significantly increase Trading Volume of the Financial Industry, become an outstanding customer relationship tool for Brokers and reduce entry barriers and risks for Traders.  OTSO group is more than meet the eye, we provide not only Tech Solutions, but also Liquidity (through our own liquidity provider), Fintech Consulting (Turn-key Brokerage set up including licenses) and Data Analytics (we make trading data actually useful).

Just need to pick and choose an itinerary among the ones available in the portal, customise it based on the personal needs, and finally book each single travel product, from the outbound flight to the museum entrance fee, in a single seamless flow. This is a win-win mechanism: who is looking for ideas but is not willing to get the usual pre-packaged tour can actually create his own tailored trip, who shares his stories and hidden gems can value his experience, getting rewarded based on how many users he inspired to hit the road.

Guardian’s optical sensors use an advanced, patented technology that detects the presence of humans even where there is no direct line of sight. The depth sensor detects the motions of the various objects within a given scene. Their algorithm then classifies the typical motions of humans, animals and objects.

It will also provide online AI professional services like customer service, personal assistant, financial advisor, medical, legal, and other more advanced ones using an advanced language interface for speech and text. https://youtu.be/YE31u1FmoyA https://youtu.be/YE31u1FmoyA ORBAI is working on a new AI architecture with proprietary neural nets, tools, and processes that allow us to build advanced sensory processing and memory systems that mimic the human brain's ability to perceive, remember, predict, and plan. With this and the built in language capability, our Human AI Interface is able to be a powerful conversational voice assistant on platforms like mobile, smart homes and appliances, and in your vehicle, and also perform real information and customer-facing vocations online, like Medical, Finance, Legal, and others. As the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) core advances, it becomes more powerful, with a broader data reach, and more advanced cognition, planning, prediction, vocational and communication skills. Companies could use it to plan their corporate strategy via their current Enterprise Resource Planning tools by interfacing them to our AGI and having it watch and learn their company’s internal operations, gather data about their whole ecosystem of customers, suppliers, partners, competitors, and the other market factors, then forecast different timelines and how they evolve into the future differently according to their decisions, allowing you to optimize their corporate decision-making and plan effective prescient timelines for product development, marketing/PR, sales, finance, legal,… into the future. Ordinary people can use it to plan their lives, evaluating different decisions they could make, from career, to marriage, to finances, and to see the trajectory of events that would result, and the probable outcomes. They can access AGI professional services like Finance, Legal, Medical, Counselor, Fitness Advisor, and hundreds of others, and these services would be available globally, rivaling the best such services by humans. An Artificial General Intelligence will quickly become the most powerful tool that humanity has ever had, making the revolutions spawned by electricity, computers, and the internet pale by comparison.

We aimed to solve this by creating an Artificial Intelligence engine that could bring a patient to diagnosis based on their current medical state, symptoms and past medical history. In our pursuit we analyzed over 3 million patient records in engineering an AI model that could lead a naive patient right to diagnosis through simple questioning. Our algorithm became quite robust and reached nearly 80% accuracy. As we continued our research, meeting with more and more doctors, we found that the most immediately impactful application of our AI would come in automating medical documentation and administrative tasks slowing down practitioners. We decided to expand our focus from simply to diagnosis, to automating processes across the medical clinic. In everything we do, our goal is to help practitioners get back to what they do best ... medicine! Insig takes care of the rest! Why Remote Data Capture? Collecting patient information is absolutely critical in providing quality healthcare. Our intelligent questionnaire system automates the rendering of medical notes, the collection and organization of medical history, and rendering of any original paperwork/forms. Why Virtual Care?
