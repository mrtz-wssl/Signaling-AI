Over 90% of generated or collected data provides no business or analytical value, yet we pay to collect and store it. Meanwhile, data production is only increasing at an exponential rate. The root causes are lack of skilled resources, lack of automation in current tools and ever-growing volumes of data. Research shows that this problem is felt across nearly every industry, across both public and private sector entities, and at multiple levels of the organization. Yet nearly every leader places Analytics and becoming more data-informed as a priority.  The Inzata Solution Inzata is a next-generation, AI-augmented software platform that solves this challenge head-on.  Inzata provides a platform and tools to speed and streamline the process of turning raw data into valuable insights and knowledge, usable by anyone, no technical degree required.

Mild TBI, which is also known as concussion, is difficult to diagnose with current diagnostic methods such as CT and MRI scans.   Solution: Medicortex is working towards the incorporation of brain injury biomarkers into a hand-held diagnostic kit, which will give a reliable result rapidly and will not require medical professionals to interpret the result. Business: We identified a unique biomarker that can be detected from urine and saliva. With strong clinical evidence and protected idea, we are willing to negotiate with bigger diagnostic companies for collaboration on manufacturing and distribution.   Market: Customers include hospitals, emergency rooms, paramedics and first responders, military paramedics, sports teams (especially contact sports such as rugby, American football, ice hockey), schools, pharma and insurance companies.

Today if you want to buy and sell a car you have two bad options: 1) classifieds which are unsafe and require a lot of work or 2) car dealers which will offer you a much worse price than private parties in order to cover their fixed cost. The way CARUPI works is that we send professional photographers to your home to take photos of your car, we publish it on classified sites, manage the back-forth with buyers so you don't need to interact with them and using our escrow we manage the entire transaction end-to-end.  The market for this is absolutely huge - $70B in Brazil alone and over $2T globally. Just like Airbnb changed vacation rentals and homes from classified and travel agents we will change the used car industry from the ground up. Founder Diego Fischer, founder and CEO of CARUPI, has previously built the largest C2B car marketplace in Brazil. Led it to US$100M GMV run rate in 2.5yrs. Raised US$30M. Led 220 people.

Our flagship product, FxMammo, is an AI Assistant that significantly improves the screening procedure for mammograms by reducing the false positive rates by as much as 67% and enhancing the clinical workflow by reducing the time taken to assess a screen as well as the number of radiologists required per screen. Our algorithm was based off over 3 years of research at NUS and we have recently published on the prestigious AAAI Workshop and Jama Open Network Journal. We are also a portfolio company of the MedTech JUMPStart Program. FathomX’s unique AI Model for mammogram started out in a global competition - The Dream Challenge organised by the United States’ Whitehouse. As the top Asian team in the global competition that featured more than 100 participants from around the world, the founders decided to spin-off the company with the support of NUS Enterprise. From the time of the competition, the AI model has also progressed tremendously in its predictive accuracy, refinement and users’ preference are incorporated and continuously upgraded to meet differing and progressing needs. Within a year from incorporation, the company has secured several research collaborations with major hospitals including the National University Hospital and Kandang Kerbau Women and Children’s Hospital in Singapore, Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan and Taipei Medical University in Taiwan. On the commercialisation front, a co-investment and co-development deal with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was signed that will see the company gain access to HPE’s engineering team as well as potential access to over 130 hospital clients in the APAC region. We have also executed a data transfer agreement with multiple research agencies like Lifepool (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Australia). The company has also recently accepted SGD1.25 Million I2Start funding Pathway and is also one of the finalists of the prestigious MedTech Innovator competition in Singapore. FathomX has also been featured on multiple news media including Channel News Asia, Tamil Seithi, Channel 8 News, Enterprise SPARKS and TEDx.

Through “Project PetaGene,” a collaboration with the Stegle Group at EMBL-EBI, they researched how to compress huge amounts of genomic data—without compromising data quality. Three years later, PetaGene is much more than a research project. They took their idea to London’s Entrepreneur First incubator and graduated with the program’s sixth cohort in 2016. That same year, they won Best of Show for their PetaSuite compression tools at Bio-IT World’s annual conference in Boston, beating out 46 competitors from 190 total exhibiting companies. Now, they’re a full-fledged company with a suite of products that do what they hoped they would when they began their research at the University of Cambridge: compress genomic data up to 6x, without affecting the quality of the data.

Our mission is to create innovative, efficient & practical software solutions for digital identity management and the protection of personal user data. Blinking is a digital identity platform built with a 'privacy by design' approach and principles. It is a multi-platform software solution designed for the creation, confirmation, and management of users’ identities. Organizations relying on our platform receive a reliable, safe, and easy way of confirming their users’ identity, while their end-users retain ownership and control of their own private data. The current model of manually acquiring data and documents on physical premises or through insecure and unverified digital channels is outdated. People leave copies of their data and documents in the hands of each provider whose service they use. This model is insecure, prone to breach, identity theft, misuse of private data and is costly in terms of both the time and money from the individuals and organizations in order to operate it.  Our digital identity management platform provides user registration or onboarding, identity verification, and data & document management environment. Blinking technologies combine Hyperledger Fabric blockchain architecture, a private, permissioned, and scalable blockchain solution, cloud services infrastructure, and in-house developed biometric recognition algorithms. Identify is our standalone SaaS solution designed to enable remote customer onboarding or user registration. It offers a simple, secure, and efficient user experience of registering for a product or a service.  Verify is our identity verification and multi-factor authentication tool designed to increase the level of trust between your services and your customers. It is a robust digital identity management system whose primary function is to provide organizations with a tool to verify their user’s or customer’s identities each time they want to use a provided digital service using a multi-factor approach with biometric verification.
